      "Ordering three throw pillows of Toronto neighbourhoods was easy and straightforward. I was very pleased with the great service I received from Pam in making sure that my deliveries were fast and efficient. I was delightfully surprised to find David\u2019s exceptional art on both sides of the pillows. I\u2019m impressed with the high quality of the poly-linen fabric as well as the vibrant, rich colours. I am a proud supporter of items made in Canada and can\u2019t wait to give one of these pillows as a gift this Christmas. Sure to be a conversation opener.",
      "Thank you for the excellent quality products, fast delivery and fantastic selection of David Crighton\u2019s art. There are so many great gift ideas on the website. We decided to get ten postcards to frame and mount on our wall of all of our favourite places, neighbourhoods and landmarks in Toronto that are meaningful to us. Each piece tells our story and we just love it. We will definitely order from Totally Toronto Art again!",
      "I have purchased art from David since 1994 and share my purchases with friends from out of country who have visited Toronto. Puzzles, calendars, cards, postcards, posters are all of the finest quality and I am never disappointed in the beautiful detail David puts into every image. I am looking forward to a new piece depicting the renovated Massey Hall when  it is finished in a couple of years!",
      "I'm  very pleased with all the David Crighton products I've received,  posters, postcards, greeting cards and pillows.  The quality is excellent and the colours are so vibrant.  The customer service is also excellent.  David Crighton has produced pillows depicting a wide variety of U. S. landmarks.  They, as well as all other products I've ordered, display  beautiful , vibrant artwork reproduced on high quality materials.",
      "My first purchase was a wedding gift for my nephew in 1997...As he was being transfered to the USA... I presented him with the ' My Toronto '  framed. Since then I have purchased  calendars several years.. mugs.. cards.. ' My Toronto ' pouch and Tote Bag. Most have been gifts . but I still have my eye on many other items... I want for myself the ' My Toronto  '  Poster... wish I could manage the framed one but the poster one will be just as cherished. I will continue to give David's incredible unique items as gifts in the future. As well I continue to spread the word. So many to choose from... love them all!!!"

      "Had an incredible time experiencing the Power Plant's Summer 2022 Exhibition Season! The Mixed media Artworks by Hiwa K in particular were very moving and, eye-opening. Thanks to places like this Contemporary Art Galleries we get glimpses of so much that is beyond our general awareness.",
      "I love coming down here to see the exhibits. It's free and accessible. All located on ground level, you can see fantastic artwork inside and outside. They often rotate, so check online for what is on exhibit.  It's also close to the Harbourfront. You can hit two birds with one stone.  I recommend you come if you can.",

May is \"Museum  Month\" in the city of Toronto, meaning that you can get into nine city of Toronto-run museums for free with your Toronto library card. Visit here and you will get a terrific view of the St Lawrence Market below.",

I didn't know where those murals come from. It has been a discovery to know that there is a huge work from the City of Toronto and many artist not only to decorate the city but also to mentor artists at all stages of their development.",

      "We were here for the beginners ceramics class last summer. It was a fun (albeit pricey) experience. It was however soured somewhat when a lady came in and very politely informed the owner that she was following up on some matter - the owner (who was nothing but wonderful towards us) responded very rudely/aggressively. I\u2019m not sure of the backstory, but it didn\u2019t look good from our viewpoints.  Our dishes turned out well, except that two of them were dyed using the wrong colours (when we mentioned this, while collecting we got a \u201coh yeah, that happens sometimes\u201d response from the person who gave them to us).  We bought a few ceramic mugs here as well. They\u2019ve lasted and are amongst my favourites.",
      "Last year, my partner planned a ceramic workshop at the Dish Gallery and i can honestly say it was one of the best experiences anyone has ever given me as a gift.  We had the workshop to ourselves and Susan really took her time in explaining the history and process of working with ceramics.  She was patient and kind while answering all of our questions.  I loved choosing the pattern stamps, and was very happy with the product. I quickly learned that less is more in creating patterns.  As a beginner, i do not recommend expecting the items to turn out exactly how you assume they will; we were aiming for noodle bowls, but i was not strong enough to press down and create the desired depth on my first try. However, i still love and use the bowls (for fruits, yorgurt, etc). We also created small dishes that we use for soya sauce. I also use every single item for the Iranian Spring Festival/ New Year table every year.  The time seemed slightly short when we got near the end, and the price isnt exactly cheap. But definitely an experience worth investing in.  Thankn you \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9b",

      "We give out Inuit carvings for 10 years of service with our company, and when looking for a new supplier, I found Northern Expressions via Google. After reviewing their website and seeing the large selection of carvings in various price ranges, I took a chance and ordered 3 sculptures for our upcoming BBQ where they will be handed out to the 10 year employees. I cannot say enough nice things about the service that was provided to me by the partner Olu Falope. He called to personally guarantee that i would have my packages before our event and he came in person to deliver them. They are beautifully gift wrapped with personalized cards on each for the recipients. I will be using Northern Expressions moving forward for our anniversary gifts.",

      "Don't forget to use \u029c\u1d0f\u1d1b\u1d07\u029f\u0299o\u029f\u029f\u028f.\u1d04\u1d0fm when booking your resort. This web site will compare thousands of booking websites and normally will have prices much cheaper compared to others! You're welcome :)! This hotel is one of my favorites in the area. I have been staying here for a long time. If you decide to stay here you definitely will love it I'm sure!  I recently had a solo short week stay at Gladstone House. It is lovely, centrally located and full of interesting and beautiful artful touches. The bed, linens and towels are first class! Staff are welcoming, went beyond helpful and added to the fun atmosphere! Very service oriented!! I look forward to staying there again!",
      "For the price I paid I was perfectly located next to everything needed (bars, restaurants, grocery store and public transit) and the hotel was aesthetically pleasing. However, for the price I paid, I was very displeased with housekeeping and noise level. I\u2019ve paid way less and received fresh towels, sheets, and a made bed on a daily basis. That\u2019s not the case here, housekeeping done a very poor job at providing quality service during my stay. Dropped off towels (not all needed) and completely skipped making the bed. When called to address the housekeeping made bed the next day with same sheets (this is with the room needs cleaning sign). While the hotel was aesthetically pleasing the shower and sink drainage were not user friendly. Elevator was not convenient unless a doorman was available, so prepare to use the stairs often.  Lastly the walls are extremely thin and you can hear everyone in the halls.  I would not recommend if comfort and relaxation is the goal. I would recommend if you can catch a deal and location is your only concern.",
      "Nice hotel. Great concierge. Fantastic location. Horrible room placement.  There was a wedding there the night my husband and I were going to stay there. Which is totally fine. Great even. However, if they know there will be a wedding there, I have no idea why they would give people a room (who were not at the wedding) that was right OVER the party.  We could literally FEEL the music. When we called down to tell them and ask if there was another room, we were told there were no other rooms available that were not above the wedding and that the wedding was due to go until 1am.  With that, we were frantically trying to find somewhere else to stay at 11pm. Luckily we got a full refund and found a quiet hotel to stay in.  We would have loved to stay there, but it seems like a MAJOR oversight of the hotel to allow for the rooms over the wedding to be booked by people other than those who are at the wedding. On a night there is going to be a wedding there, those rooms should be strictly for guests of the wedding or the bride and groom.  If you plan on staying here, I would recommend you either request a room on the opposite side of Gladstone Ave. or ask if there is going to be a wedding on the night(s) of your stay.",
      "For a simple night stay in the liberty village area this was adequate. The rooms are small with creative modern solutions to use the space. But all we needed was a bed and bathroom so it was more than fine. The staff were very nice and helpful, and getting checked in was easy.  However, with the bar below and common room spaces near the hotel rooms, our Saturday night sleep was constantly ruined by yelling across the hotel hallways, music, and loud groups talking; we got in around 2am to just crash and get a good night's sleep but sadly couldn't get to sleep due to the noise.  I feel if this party setup was what they were going for, they would have set up much better sound proofing so other guests could actually use the rooms to sleep.",
      "Beautifully renovated to suit the modern lifestyle around it, the Gladstone Hotel keeps exquisite architectural parts of its past from 1889. Each floor has a lounge with different purposes (library, games room, and sitting area), and the elevator is an experience itself, exhibiting its history and durability.  Despite our room's eclectic and minimalistic design,  it was comfortable and simplistic. With the sink separate from the shower and toilet, my husband and I were able to get ready for a wedding simultaneously. Just a couple of steps from our room featured a small alcove with an Nespresso machine, dispensing hot water for tea and flavour pods, and a mini fridge (for cream!).  The staff were amiable and incredible, and extremely helpful when I encountered minor problems (that were my fault, I promise). It was also incredibly easy to check in and out after our long drive.  Thank you for a wonderful experience! I will return in the future!"

      "We had our wedding at Twist Gallery in July. The venue itself is stunning. It\u2019s unique, industrial, rustic, and classy at the same time. The windows, the beams, and the changing art on the walls makes it for such a special venue. It was absolutely the best venue and the best experience we\u2019ve had. Nadia and Emanuelle are super easy to communicate with. All of our questions and requests were answered promptly, and they help to keep you organized. The day of set up and tear down was timely and seamless. All the venue staff, the day of coordinator, the waitresses and bartenders, and food catered by Gusto were amazing. The guests kept raving about how much they loved everything. Would highly recommend for a wedding or any other event!",
      "We are so thrilled we decided to go with Twist Gallery as our wedding venue. We only had about 5 months to pull our wedding together and Twist made it so easy to think through all the details to make our day perfect. When you sign your contract with them, you get access to a planning document which makes planning so much easier. Closer to the date, they are super responsive and helpful with every little question you may have. The actual day of went so smooth and it is very clear they have an extremely professional and organized team. Not to mention, the venue itself is unique, beautiful and will wow your guests. We got so many compliments about the venue, our guests absolutely loved it! Thank you Twist (and especially Nadia and Emanuelle) for helping to make our wedding day absolutely perfect!",
      "We had our wedding at Twist October 2022. The venue is beautiful and everyone loved the art. Leading up to our wedding, Nadia and Emmanuelle were very helpful, answering our many emails and questions. They were very quick to respond and provided as much information as possible to make us feel comfortable leading up to our day, making the planning process very easy. The setup looked great and the venue staff were very accommodating throughout the evening. The only minor hiccup was that our ceremony reserved seating signs got lost but the staff were able to use their in-house signs instead so it did not impact the wedding. I would highly recommend Twist Gallery as a venue. Thank you Nadia, Emmanuelle & team!",
      "Had the best wedding at Twist Gallery, the staff were so attentive from everything with the bar, photos, food, and placing all decor accordingly. Definitely consider Twist if you\u2019re looking for a classically beautiful wedding.",
      "Twist provided a beautiful space for our wedding. Everything went smoothly and the food was fantastic! Nadia and Em were always available throughout the planning process and made it easy for us. Compared to other downtown venues, Twist provided very good value and outstanding customer service.

      "What an enjoyable evening, I loved every second of it! It was amazing to watch the artist bring blank canvases to life, great music, meeting amazing people and I even won a beautiful artwork in the auction! Highly recommend that you go check out one of your local events and support your local talent! \ud83e\udd70",

      "Came across SoHo framing on Instagram and decided to use their services for some new artwork. My experience was great both times I went into the store. Kody helped me with my framing order originally and when I went to pickup the owner helped me. She was friendly and even gave me the proper nails and hooks which I used. Very happy with the framework for my photographs and illustration piece. Would return here for any future framing.",
      "Edit: The owner has responded to my original review with false information and an attack on my personal character. To clarify, there was never any phone communication (only by e-mail or in-person), there was never any offer to change the type of frame, there was never any offer of a refund until I requested today, and I have only ever had pleasant exchanges with the staff and sales manager (who kindly provided the refund today).  I'm honestly stunned at the level of defensiveness and dishonesty in the owner's response, but it also reinforces some of the issues I outlined in my original review. I would strongly advise against bringing your business here.  Original review: I would not bring my business here again. I ordered 2 small pieces of art to be framed in mid-July. The first piece was finished after 3 weeks, but initially not centered properly in the matting/frame (photo attached). Instead of acknowledging the issue and suggesting ways it could be fixed, the owner was defensive and insisted that \"it just needs to settle in the frame\" and \"the edges of the drawing aren't straight\". It felt like I had to work to persuade them to have it re-done and centered properly. Remarkably, the second order was never completed. Over 3 months, I received zero communication from the store about the order. I finally just went in and asked for the second piece to be returned, and I'm grateful that an employee provided a refund. If there was an issue with supply, they could have simply suggested an alternate frame that was in stock, or at the very least communicated that there would be a delay. My impression from this experience was that the quality of work and communication/customer service are below average, particularly given the price of services.",
      "Fantastic experience at SOHO. Brought in several pieces requiring variety of work from new matting to frames and glass type. Kody was incredible! The initial apt was a few hours and we greatly appreciated his suggestions, expertise and friendly demeanour. The pieces turned out exactly as we\u2019d hoped. Highly recommend seeing Kody, it was a great experience at SOHO thanks to him!",
      "Tamar is so lovely and helpful when getting things framed! We are lucky to have such a caring shop owner in our neighbourhood and now our home is filled with beautifully framed memories!",
      "Excellent customer service, we are a corporate company, we requested a magazine print quality in a three-part frame, Kody took our request, shared the mock-up, payment was smooth, received frame in a day and was done perfectly, great quality, perfectly done we love it thank you again!!"

      "great free exhibits. would benefit from some wall text. also very hard to find front door",
      "I love the Arsenal galleries. Toronto's is smaller than Montreal's, usually with one main exhibit and one smaller gallery. But it seems to allow them to be selective and choose some really spectacular installation exhibits, and create a singular, unique atmosphere in the space.  Highly recommend a visit, especially if you're visiting MoCA a couple blocks away!  Check to make sure they're open (i.e. not between installations) when planning. That goes for most galleries though.",
      "Like it\u2019s location in Montr\u00e9al, Arsenal Contemporary Art in Toronto is a must see! Whether you are a local or you are simply visiting Toronto, their carefully curated exhibitions with both Canadian and international artists is something not to miss!",
      "Such rude customer service. The woman working the front desk had such a sour attitude it totally ruined the experience. The exhibition itself was wonderful, I tried to grab a brochure at the end and woman was so rude, and passive aggressive.",
      "David Liss who was previously at the MOCA does curatorial projects here. He always has a unique view of contemporary artists and selects fascinating artists who are accomplished but not completely mainstream. The shows are often museum quality at Arsenal/Division - in both substance & presentation."

      "I love the welcoming atmosphere at this gallery ,  the time that the owner takes to walk you through each piece of art exhibited is extraordinary. Amazed by her knowledge and talent to tell each painting like a story. I first saw the works of Marco Sassone at Berenson Art and fell in love with them. I also deeply enjoyed some other exhibits like \"Home\". The owner was kind enough to introduce the artist to my little one who is an animal lover,  she was super excited and remembers that experience to date! Always enjoy visiting the gallery. Keep up the great work!",
      "Very nice gallery with diverse list of artists. Small but well appointed space. They have great opening nights for their exhibitions where you can meet the artist and socialize with local Toronto crowds. The permanent collection has wonderful selection of photography. Many international artists on the stable along with well known Canadian painters. Most of their exhibitions are featured in national news and press. I have been a client of the gallery since it\u2019s opening in 2011 and would highly recommend anyone interested in art to visit it.",
      "I have had the pleasure of attending most of the artist exhibits at Berenson Fine Art and have been amazed at the caliber of talent that has graced their walls.  A couple of pieces that I have by Marco Sassone, who has a permanent exhibit there and is an internationally renowned artist, with artwork in galleries and museums around the world.  You can usually see exhibiting artists in featured on the news and in publications.  Definitely keep an eye out and try to make it to one of the shows.  They are fabulous!",
      "Berenson Fine Art Gallery is the epidome of Fine Art gallery. Berenson can pride itself not only for the extraordinary collections and exhibitions but also for the expert staff. I have expanded my collection with several pieces from Berenson Fine Art Gallery. Whether you are looking for beautiful oil painting or a water color or a photograph or a drawing, this gallery must be a stop on your list. Emilia's wealth of knowledge will inform and entertain you and she and her staff will make sure you are a happy return collector! Thank you Berenson for being a True Fine Art Gallery, and thank you for curating wonderful shows and exhibitions for Toronto's Fine Art connoisseur community.",

      "I took A1.1 lessons which is most basic level serving learners who do not know a word of french.. In the name of immersion the tutors would only speak in french & respond back in french.. I ended up not learning anything. To understand what was being spoken in class, I needed to use google translate. I would not recommend anyone with no French back ground from joining this course.",
      "I took private lessons with Ga\u00eblle Deschamps for the past half-year. She has always been extremely organized and very well prepared for lessons. The lesson notes are clear and concise in a Google Doc making them easy to access whenever I need to refer to a past concept.  The topics she chose were always very stimulating and varied from week to week so that I build a firm foundation in the knowledge required for eventually completing B1. For many of the lessons she provided real world examples (websites from France, videos from France, resources for grammar etc.) that I could see how the new grammar concepts are applied as well as build my vocabulary. She was very patient to review anything that I did not fully understand or assimilate when it was presented in earlier lessons.  She is a fabulous professor and I would highly recommend lessons with her.",
      "I just finished my 3rd online ZOOM course with AF.  A fantastic way to learn French and enjoy the company of other students online.    The course instructors are all great with an easy manner and boundless enthusiasm for making sure you get the most out of your journey with the French language and culture.",
      "I took two conversation courses online and was quite happy. Our teacher was Taraneh Vafaee. She has a very pleasant way of teaching that makes the classes interesting, informal while getting us to learn a lot. She takes into consideration repeat students, (she gets them as they like her way of teaching) and does not repeat the texts and subjects she used in the previous course so one never gets bored. Being a conversation course the teacher needs to adapt its level to the level of the students which can vary a lot even if the students have been assessed and given a level. She is able to this very well.  I do have a proposal for getting the course even better:  At the end of the course it would greatly help to give each student an evaluation in order for the student to be able to judge on the best method to improve further. At this time, unless expressly requested, there is no evaluation brief report.",
      "Jolanda deserves a medal from the Government of Canada and the Government of France for her efforts to teach French. She really deserves to be recognized - she is most deserving. I feel very lucky and I am grateful she is my professor. She is totally amazing. She truly inspires me at each lesson to work harder and to continue with my French studies - My private tuition fees with Alliance Francis are totally worth it!!!!  Jolanda has the most amazing patience when she corrects me and repeats corrections - she never makes me feel bad about my errors she makes me want to improve and be more proficient. She takes the time to explain French grammar to me and as a result I understand it more and more.  As much as I am a senior,  Jolanda makes me want to learn more about the French language and to speak it well.I will start my third year with her in September  Its is also very helpful  the learning material and exercises are excellent and well written which allows me to learn step by step.  Also the audio dialogue on the CD's is very good and allows me to improve my understanding of oral French.  - I am one very happy student of Alliance  Francais  and it is because of Jolanda !!!! merci : )"

      "The \"Galerie de Bellefeuille\" has redefined the \"5 star\" standard of perfection and excellence amongst local art galleries in Toronto. Established in September Toronto in 2017, this art gallery is definitely a \"must see\" gallery in the Toronto area. It exceeds by far other art galleries in Toronto, as well as other galleries worldwide. Their select and tasteful collection of contemporary/pop art is nothing short of sensational. The gallery's layout is perfect and very well lit, and the staff is genuinely friendly, welcoming, helpful, and knowledgeable.",
      "Beautiful and moderate large gallery featuring some unique artworks. Very Yorkville vibe though. It's nice and cute. Friendly people.",
      "A gorgeous light filled gallery that is spacious and shows the contemporary art well. Fitting that it's located in the upscale neighborhood of Yorkville.",
      "I've only walked by this gallery when it was closed, but I love the colourful sculptures and photos. I don't know their pricing, but I would imagine it's not cheap.",
      "Amazing staff! We were there with my daughter for a friends gallery opening and they were so welcoming to her."

Awa and her colleagues were exceptionally attentive and thorough in their follow up in securing a replacement. In the current environment, things will go wrong. What matters most is how a business responds. This one responded exceptionally well. I thoroughly recommend not just for the art work, but for the service.",

The organization\u2019s values, business model, and quality service are all bedrocks I would open a gallery around.  They have disrupted the industry and have tapped into a new art audience in the process.",
      "Happy to see LUMAS has made it to Toronto! Great place to pick up museum-quality, limited edition, photographic artwork at a fair price range. Incredible staff, portfolio, and location. Love the European concept. Highly recommend to anyone looking for artwork for their home or business.",
      "I went to Lumas because I was looking for small artworks to put in my living room and I was really surprised by the large range of options that Lumas offers. The quality is also very good whether you have a big or a small budget. The smallest piece I've got from them was only 38$ with a guarantee on it. I also wanted to mention the staff, everybody was very nice and helpful!"

      "I contracted with Image Foundry for reproductions of two much loved oil paintings done by an artist family friend to whom we were returning the originals. The reproductions were phenomenal. The colours in the repros were, in my opinion, indistinguishable from the originals. I highly recommend Image Foundry to anyone who wishes to get a work of art reproduced.",
      "I was in the gallery when Mr. Dhaliwal came in. As always, Dimitri was nothing but courteous and professional. I have been a client of Imagefoundry for several years. Dimitri's work is outstanding. He has the highest of standards. On a personal level, he is always professional. He combines that with kindness and a great sense of humor. There are many very good reasons why so many artists, myself included come here from all over the province to avail ourselves of the excellent service and product offered by Dimitri at Imagefoundry.",
      "I use Dimitri Levanoff of Image Foundry for digitally imaging my original artwork. He is thorough, professional, highly skilled and intuitive when it comes to dealing with the vagaries of varying media and requirements. His work has always been done to the highest standards. He gives you images tailored to your own requirements, and has clear suggestions if ever you feel ambiguous or uncertain of your own end goals when it comes to what to do with the digital images he supplies. I have found his large format print service to be completely satisfactory as well. Not to mention he has a beautiful dog that greets you without being demanding!",
      "I approached Imagefoundry with a small job to scan two collages to create prints of the originals to give as Christmas gifts.  Dimtri, was helpful, straightforward, flexible and very fair in the pricing of my small projects.  I am absolutely thrilled with the quality of the resulting prints and the support I received during the process.  Already thinking about another project to reproduce and share other family art.  I highly recommend Imagefoundry.",
      "I am really happy with the scans I had done with Dimitri. He was very professional and attentive. He took the time to sit with me and go over each image (there were over 20). He also took the time to speak to me over the phone regarding details after the initial job was done. Highly recommend!"

      "great free exhibits. would benefit from some wall text. also very hard to find front door",
      "I love the Arsenal galleries. Toronto's is smaller than Montreal's, usually with one main exhibit and one smaller gallery. But it seems to allow them to be selective and choose some really spectacular installation exhibits, and create a singular, unique atmosphere in the space.  Highly recommend a visit, especially if you're visiting MoCA a couple blocks away!  Check to make sure they're open (i.e. not between installations) when planning. That goes for most galleries though.",
      "Like it\u2019s location in Montr\u00e9al, Arsenal Contemporary Art in Toronto is a must see! Whether you are a local or you are simply visiting Toronto, their carefully curated exhibitions with both Canadian and international artists is something not to miss!",
      "Such rude customer service. The woman working the front desk had such a sour attitude it totally ruined the experience. The exhibition itself was wonderful, I tried to grab a brochure at the end and woman was so rude, and passive aggressive.",
      "David Liss who was previously at the MOCA does curatorial projects here. He always has a unique view of contemporary artists and selects fascinating artists who are accomplished but not completely mainstream. The shows are often museum quality at Arsenal/Division - in both substance & presentation."

      "Queen\u2019s Shop is an amazing hidden gem on Bloor St. I have not visited a hair salon in Toronto for such a long time, so I felt really lucky I found this location by chance. The salon was clean, safe, they follow COVID protocol, and they\u2019re so friendly about it too!  Diyar did an amazing job highlighting my dark asian hair! I always struggled with explaining what exactly I wanted with my hairdresser and Diyar was able to translate my blundering description into exactly what I wanted! I love my hair! They brightened up my hair to this lovely sandy colour that feels healthy and not fried up at all. Whenever I am in Toronto this is my go-to place for hair. I\u2019ll let my before/after photos speak for themselves.  This is the place! GO HERE! You\u2019ll thank me later!",
      "I have spent the last decade in search of a hairdresser who understood my thick and curly hair, my personal style, and who is a pleasure to spend time with. I have found all of these qualities in Rachel so when she recently moved to Queen\u2019s Shop I followed.  Every time I see Rachel, I leave with the best haircut I\u2019ve ever had. She is also incredibly kind and personable and I really look forward to my upcoming appointments. She has never commented negatively on how much hair I have so I don\u2019t feel like I need to apologize in advance every time I sit in the chair. Thanks to Rachel, I feel like I can stray from \u201csafe\u201d cuts because I know I\u2019m in great hands and I also know she\u2019s going to find the perfect balance between my inspiration photos and my hair type. And the cozy and welcoming environment of Queen\u2019s Shop is the icing on the cake. Highly recommended!!!",
      "I have been going to Queen's Shop for a couple of years now and every time it is such a great experience. I love the emphasis on sustainability at the salon and it is always very clean. Ari is an amazing stylist, I appreciate them taking the time to really understand what I want and cutting my hair in a way that really compliments my face! I always feel so confident walking out of the salon after getting my hair done by Ari! Highly recommend!",
      "I went to Queen\u2019s shop for a major colour correction. They walked me through the whole process and took their time ensuring my hair was never compromised. Even though the process was quite long (I had been warned it would be), they were very patient and attentive to my needs throughout. I came out with a great cut, colour and highlights! Thank you so much Alicia and team!",
      "I have been attending this salon for over two years now. My stylist / colourist went on mat leave and I saw someone new to the salon. I paid $300 for a root touch up and a cut. A significant amount of my roots remained grey (approximately 40-50%). When I contacted the salon owner / manager to let them know, they were dismissive. I was offered to come in the next week to correct the issue or a free treatment, the value of which is under $20. I expressed concern for my hair and personal health and as a result, I am not comfortable treating my hair so much in a short period of time. My concerns were not respected despite that I paid a significant amount of money for a service I did not receive. Many other options were available to make this right and the owner / manager of the salon did not care to work together to resolve the issue. As a result, I will no longer be going to this salon and feel that other consumers should be aware of this experience so they can make informed decisions.  Edited to reply to salon owner below: Alicia, you ghosted me when I expressed to you that there were options to discuss besides the free treatment or forcing me to do something I was not comfortable doing. I also requested a phone call to discuss and you never called. It was not my responsibility to make this right, it was yours. If resolution of this came from a place of valuing your customer and standing behind the product your salon offers, you could have expressed to me an interest in hearing my suggestions or come up with some compromises of your own."

      "Great Hideaway theatre, rich with film history and architecture on the walls. Great staff that makes you feel welcomed. Imagine Cinemas has great popcorn! * some of the theatres have smaller screens then I\u2019m used to. But enjoyment wasn\u2019t affected especially seating in the reclining seats.",
      "great place! been here twice in the last week accidentally but we\u2019ve been the only ones in the theatre both times! it\u2019s great and we love the sofa recliners- game changer",
      "An amazing value for money and such a great experience. The seats are definitely top notch and the screen is brilliant as well as the sound. Definitely not IMAX but definitely more than worth what you pay for.  Highly recommend going during weekdays since we had the theatre almost to ourselves.",
      "5 stars just based on the seats? Yes. Everything else is standard movie theater business as usual. There is no cell service downstairs and no wi-fi.",
      "My all time favourite movie theatre! I love how it\u2019s not shiny, new and high tech like Cineplex. It has this old school look and feel, staff are friendly and inviting, and once your in your movie and you lay back in the reclining chairs with your snacks, your in heaven."

      "Amazing Dolby surround sound experience in this theatre.  I was here for Doctor strange and it was fun since the plan was very spontaneous. The 3D glasses are crystal clear and they clean and decent.  They have amazing cafeteria and has popcorn coke and other meals available.  There is good leg space on the top row chairs and the experience of imax makes it even better.",
      "First time watching a movie at this theater. It is quite large with 14/15 screening rooms. We watched The Matrix Resurrections pre-screening on December 16th. The whole building was decked out to give it a Matrix themed feel it was really well done. Theatre seating was at 50% capacity so it didn\u2019t feel crowded and we were able to keep a safe distance from everyone. Getting into the theater was a bit crowded but everyone was masked and once you got into the room it was fine. The screens are a good size and the sound system is good as well.  There is underground parking in the same building which is convenient. PARKING TIP: DO NOT PAY AT THE KIOSKS. PAY AT THE EXIT GATE WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD. We made the mistake of paying at the kiosk and then tried to exit the parking lot but because there was a huge line of cars trying leave, it took us 45min to make it to the exit gate after the show and ended up having to pay the parking fee twice because we took too long to get out. Or better yet, don\u2019t drive. Since we were coming from outside the city we unfortunately had to drive.",

      "Love how intimate the theatre is and the location (near College Station). I like how they have dairy-free \"butter\" for popcorn (which is of no extra cost). You can also get flavourings and real butter (which costs extra).",
      "A really surprising theater. I came there for the first time and thought to myself \"this looks a bit creepy\", but this thought completely disappeared when I entered it. Its really cosy and familial. The screening rooms are small but cosy and you really connect with the audience more.",
      "I love this place. This is the equivalent to your hole in the wall restaurant where people are nice and the food is great. Theatres are small and cozy, $10 regular ticket and $7 on Tues. You can get bar drinks or boozy slushies (!) or tea on addition to your regular movie fare. Highly recommended!",
      "Great place if you like watching films in a quieter space. The seats are comfy and the overall atmosphere is cozy. Staff are very friendly. The selection of films is great, they'll have newer releases 2-3 months after they come out as well as showing older films.",
      "I went to this theatre 10 years ago and it was a dump then. Took my son to see minions today thinking it must have been renovated since my last visit...... wrong! I have underwear bigger than the screen it was showing on. Got a refund, staff were very kind and understanding."

The movie selections are really good as movies which don't get released elsewhere are present here. Members also get to watch movies for free too and the price of a ticket is also very affordable as well. Definitely make a trip to watch international acclaim movies without fail.",

Not privileged enough to get into the lounge so had to settle for the smaller cafeteria experience. Gift shop offered many TIFF assortment of purchase options and very informative staff. Very clean, well maintained."

      "Such a great experience!  This was my first time going to this Cineplex and I can easily say it was much nicer than others I\u2019ve been to. Not only is it conveniently located, but it\u2019s really easy getting tickets and entering in.  All workers checked vaccination receipts correctly and wouldn\u2019t let you enter without proof of vaccination.  I went to see The French Dispatch which was located on the upper level. The theatre was kept quite clean and I had no complaints.  Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area!",
      "I love this place. First of all Dundas square is very lively place and this Cineplex is at Dundas and Yonge street mostly into the hustle and bustle of the city where music, Yonge people and diversity can all be seen at one place. On top of everything it screens the Hindi movies as well. That is icing on cake. It houses 20+ Audi's and ambience inside the Cineplex is also great. Overall great experience. Good for families, couples, friends group of all ages. Love to go there whenever I can.",
      "One of the few Cineplexes in city where you shall find multi linguistics movies running almost every day. This Cineplex has the rare 4DX theatres which is an experience of its own kind. Rest all are pretty much similar to other Cineplex in Toronto and GTA. I shall definitely recommend this place for movies for the amazing service by staff and well maintained theatres",
      "Nice location, nice ambiance. Theater is huge with a great selection.  Not to busy. Theater was clean and comfortable. Happy with my visit!",
      "I always go to this Cinema to watch movies. It's conveniently located at the corner of Dundas and Yonge Street where the subway is. I watched the James Bond movie \"No Time To Die\" in the Imax Theatre. The place, as always, is clean and tidy. The washroom too. I think the management is really serious in keeping this place in a great shape. Highly recommended."

May be a bit tricky to find (Go down the ramp near the sculpture outside the gallery, and enter through side doors that indicate volunteer entry only). Art documentaries, arthouse films and biopics are often shown here. A cafeteria is located near the gallery but usually closes soon before the evening showtimes.",

      "Great venue! Saw a comedy show here and everything went so smoothly. Everything from getting checked in to finding seats to leaving the venue was seamless. And they have to most comfortable seats! Super friendly staff too.",
      "Great location, comfortable spacious seats, lots of good options for drinking and eating. Washrooms are clean, nice and ample. Nothing to fault here. Sound was fine and any concert or event here will surely be intimate. Nice place, makes you wish for the good ol' days when you went to the movies at great places like these and not the mass-produced, lifeless mall options of today. No wonder people just stay at home now.  We need more Royal theatres :-)",
      "The theater is beautiful! The sound is great and seats are very comfy. My only issue if I had to pick something is the concessions are way too pricy. $6 for a sparkling mineral water is a bit outrageous as well as the candy for $10. Staff could be a little more friendly especially since they are expecting tips",
      "Former community cinema that shuttered during the pandemic (after selling membership options), reborn as the shop for Volo with an occasional special comedy/film event. Wonderful venue, especially after the 2020 facelift, but no publicity for events for local foot traffic. I wish the shop staff would stop denying that the cinema ever had regular showings; I'm glad they've found a way to stay open, but they've rejected the local film-going community entirely."

The movie selections are really good as movies which don't get released elsewhere are present here. Members also get to watch movies for free too and the price of a ticket is also very affordable as well. Definitely make a trip to watch international acclaim movies without fail.",
      "First time in and loved the ambience and the screening rooms. Quite spacious and friendly ushers to direct you as needed even if it's just getting to the restroom. Not privileged enough to get into the lounge so had to settle for the smaller cafeteria experience. Gift shop offered many TIFF assortment of purchase options and very informative staff. Very clean, well maintained."

      "Came here on a Wednesday to see Metropolis, and it was one of the most unique experiences I\u2019ve ever had in Toronto. The theatre is set up in Reg\u2019s living room - there\u2019s a huge screen and a ton of cool decor. Reg does a talk at the beginning and during the intermission of the movie - mostly about his life and experiences in the industry. If you\u2019re expecting an in-depth analysis of the film, that\u2019s not what this is, but you will get his pov on some of the main themes.  Reg composes his own score for the movie - intermingling the new music with the film music - so if you\u2019re looking to watch with the original audio, keep that in mind. The new score definitely added to the unique experience.  All in all, I\u2019d recommend Cineforum if you\u2019re looking for a interesting movie-watching experience in the city. It wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, but I\u2019m really glad I went!",
      "Reg Hartt is a Toronto original. His stories are entertaining and engaging and the movies he shows are wild. His talks are a treat too. His home is full of curios and weird stuff to look at, and he is a friendly guy. Worth checking out for a unique experience. Byob",
      "This is the best cinema in Toronto. Intimate and lovingly curated. Not fancy, maybe a little worn, but done proper. Reg Hartt is a tyrant (he will kick you out if he feels you don't deserve to be there), but he is the most knowledgeable person in the business. This theatre is an institution and a gem of the city.",
      "As an American (United States) who for most of my life lacked real urbanite experiences and whose exposure to certain necessary \"counter-cultural\" experiences has been sadly limited, I will say the following.  The one time I took in a movie viewing at The Cineforum was some time in maybe 2010 or 2011 after returning to Toronto from which I had moved away after living there for 5 years.  \"Don't it always seem to know that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?\" sang Hartt's fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell.  Or in this case...Don't it always seem to know that you don't know what you got until you move away?  I honestly thought, the one time I went to CineForum, that Mr. Hartt was a little strange although fiercely intelligent, but now I think that it was my lack of understanding of him that prohibited me from being more comfortable in the experience.  My guesses about his brushes with the law are that they were generated probably by some people who consider him a threat to a status quo that doesn't deserve to remain a status quo.  From my (limited) understanding of his aesthetics and platform, he dares to question the politics and culture that dominate over controversial subjects, calling us to question our assumptions about those controversial subjects.  If I am ever lucky enough to live in Toronto again, while he is still alive and active in his current role, I would like to think that I would revisit his establishment several times.",
      "Reg Hart advertises his wed. night screening as PWYC but warning!!! this is not the reality. We tried to give him what we could afford as we are low income artists, but he told us to get out and never come back again! He was so shockingly rude that I strongly discourage anyone from supporting this man's business. He doesn't deserve your money."

      "Cinesphere is the biggest IMAX screen in Ontario, I love watching movies here in the big screen. However if it a popular movie /sold out event. Make sure u arrive an hour early to get good seats, because it can get packed.  The seats aren\u2019t the comfiest seats either they are a bit small and leg room are like any other movie theatre and not the greatest  Overall I\u2019d definitely catch a movie at cinesphere. Good way to watch a movie u missed or a classic.",
      "The Cinesphere is my favourite movie theatre ever! It is a building that looks really charming and futuristic from outside, but also is a very interesting experience when you come inside.  I watched the Wizard of Oz in 3D version and it was fantastic, the sound is so clear and crisp, the screen is huge and you feel like your inside the movie, greatly recommended for families, dates, going there with friends or even enjoying a great experience alone.  I hope they keep it open always and not only weekends!",
      "We watched Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it was breathtaking. I had seen this film more times then I've seen the sky, yet this experience was like no other. I felt like a little kid watching it for the first time, experiencing everything for the first time. The Cinesphere provided decently comfortable seats and a wide range of food and beverage. The sound quality was stunning, and the screen resolution was crisp. I thoroughly enjoyed this trip, and hope they continue to show other installments of the Indiana Jones films.",
      "Screen and sound are still great for an IMAX theatre.  Seating is getting old - cushioning is losing its support and dirty.  Seats are small and crowded feeling.  Anxiety inducing when theatre is full or others sitting beside you.  Would go again on an off time when it isn't so busy.",
      "Amazing experience, will definitely go there again. Highly recommend to be there an hour before the movie time if you want to get good seats. I went there half an hour before the movie time and just the front 3 rows were empty."

      "It's an escape from the city. You still hear the planes take off from Billy Bishop, but still much quieter compared to being next to Lake Shore. There is a long trail for walking and cycling to travel around the island. There are parks and little areas to rest and picnic. There is even a shoreline to access the lake to swim (too many rocks to be considered a beach). Overall, this is a good outdoor space.",
      "I have been going to Ontario Place since I was a kid. Now almost 60! Still a great place to hang out! Sad that some of the exhibits have gone, but new ones still keep cropping up! Centre piece is the Budweiser Stage! Good venue! But being the old buy, I miss the old rotating stage. But that is me! Good place to visit and take the kids ( or not )",
      "This is a beautiful place.  I have had great memories coming to this place as a young adult...great fireworks, live bands, drinks...  Well , it's a bit sad to see white paint is covered with rust spots...and pavilions are left in poor conditions.  The architecture is still a sight to behold after all these years.",
      "Couldn\u2019t get enough of sunset views! This will take a whole day to enjoy the whole both islands which Ontario Place is located on. Variety of fun activities for everyone!",
      "The place was awesome, great views and serene ambiance. The only problem when I went to watch a show (Cirque du Soleil), was that we had to walk ~30 mins to reach the venue. There were no buses allowed in the area, I think"

      "I walked in and around the RBC Lakeside Drive-in at Ontario Place today and curious if any further events planned as far as a drive in after TIFF",
      "The experience is great if you have only two peopl but for families with 4 or more.. anyone sitting in the back cannot see the movie. The cars are socially distanced but you are not allowed to park backwards with the trunk open or even go outside. I paid for 5 people .... $79.10 including taxes and three of the five people in this car cannot enjoy the movie....and we have tried all available options. It's extremely frustrating to have spent such a large amount of money and be unable to see the screen or remain outside to watch it... We also came to the haunted movies where characters are supposed to scare you while you are in the car .... All they do is flash lights in your face and then run away... Maybe a little dance... Which is EXTREMELY distracting from the movie. I suggest to save your money... Go to the theatre.... Or stay in with a movie on the couch... I am very disappointed. I have attached a photo of our view for 1.5 hrs.",
      "Very well organized. Great sound through car radio. Clean bathrooms and a snack bar. Good placement of cars for optimal viewing",
      "I honestly haven't been yet, but I am sure it's great. Just for those wondering however, having a vehicle (at least during COVID times) is absolutely necessary.  We bought tickets online, but the day of the show, our driver/friend that owned the car, got food poisoning and therefore could no longer go. Tried to get a refund - turns out they don't do refunds (which is understandable). But alas with no car, you cannot get into the drive in unfortunately. Which seems obvious but I figured it didn't hurt to ask under the circumstances.  So you know, try and make sure everyone's good before you go!",
      "This is the best drive in experience I've ever had. All the music on the radio is literally drive themed. Shut Up and Drive, Radio Ga Ga, Hitchin a Ride, etc. It's so amazing lol. Really professional. There are staff everywhere to answer any of your questions and guide you to your spot. Loved it. Will definitely be back again!"

The screen is set high up, which makes the ground level seating require everyone to look up higher than normal. The seats are okay. Since you have to look up, being blocked by the person in front of you is not an issue (despite it being a very gradual rise). Pick your seats in advance, online, and add them to your Apple Wallet. Staff were very friendly. Saw a great documentary so very pleased that this theatre exists. Street parking.",

Keanu also frequented the Bloor Street Cinema when he skipped drama class in high school in Toronto.  His drama teachers at the time were not pleased with him.

      "This location is mobility accessible, however there are a couple theatres that have steps to get into the theatre. Just ask a staff member and they can assist you to bypass the stairs.   The staff are very friendly and ready to assist. The location has a nice lounge area that serves alcohol and food as well. The lounge overlooks Bay Street. This is one of my favourite movie theatres that feels more personal and local.",
      "The VIP experience sucked. Except for ordering the food from the seat - I had zero vantage literally. Waste of money and worse experience.  I have been to VIP to other Cineplex locations- where the seats are so cozy, folding type for the legs/necks/back etc with lots of space.  I will never go to the VIP in this cinemas again.  I am giving two stars for the regular screens and the staff/service.",
      "My review here is mainly about the VIP experience. Buy your VIP tickets at another theatre.  The good: The servers were incredibly attentive. Our food was yummy and delivered right before our movie started.  The bad: The VIP theatres are tiny, which isn't usually a problem, except that the aisles are all very thin which makes it difficult for servers to deliver food and for movie-goers to navigate without at least stepping on a few toes. The seats are a little uncomfortable but not terrible, but the tables are absolutely tiny. Only just big enough to fit a plate of food, while praying it doesn't get knocked over by someone crab-walking to their seat. The cherry on top is the fact that the VIP theatres are located IN the lobby of this Cineplex, with barely any sound proofing. Which means whenever there's a line to get food, or a crowd just entering or exiting a movie, you can hear all the chatter just outside of the door while your movie plays. This was incredibly distracting and something I have never experienced at a Cineplex before.  If you're looking to watch a movie at this theatre, don't go to VIP. If you're looking for a VIP experience, visit another theatre.",
      "Tip parking at Manulife is $3.00 after 6 on weekdays, you just have to validate it.  There is a small Starbucks (not all drinks) along with other snacks. The theather was clean, not too many people when we went.  There are prime seats available which we didn\u2019t know about rows G & H I believe.  Overall recommend it",
      "Consistent customer experience especially for a VIP experience is essential. I cannot even begin to explain how shook I was that I paid full premium price for a screen the size of an elementary school projector and seats the same as economy. This is this most pathetic VIP movie theatre I have ever experienced and cannot believe I paid for this. The regular theatre is more of a vip experience than this and I could have used my scene points and used and watched the movie for free but instead I paid the premium price to watch a movie from a minuscule screen and uncomfy barely reclining chairs. I will never go to this cineplex ever again. I would pay $7 max for this experience but instead my friend and I paid almost $100 for a lack of resolution movie experience. Customer experience is everything and I just can\u2019t believe in such a luxurious area like young and bloor this theatre wouldn\u2019t invest in actually creating a VIP movie watching experience. Incredibly shook and disappointed. Still not sure if this is real or if I\u2019m in a movie."

      "Do NOT get a job at all at this place. This is the head office of Cineplex Entertainment and their hiring process and their training is trash. I was let go there because \"I was not the best fit.\" Well it was because their training is bad and they don't tell you that there are spots available. Their processes are trash as well as how this was organized. And the employees there suck too. All in all. DO NOT WORK AT GUEST SERVICES. The position is GARBAGE.",
      "I was told I'd receive a call after 5pm to confirm a bday party I had booked a few weeks ago. That call has yet to come and it's now approaching 9pm here. I've been trying to reach the Vaughan location for almost 2 hours now and not a single person has bothered to pick up the phone!! Now, seats for our movie are filling up quickly, I have a girlfriend who's freaking out, and her daughter is about to have her birthday party ruined. This is unacceptable!! Worst customer service ever. We're planning on just cancelling the party altogether! -_-",
      "Guys. No one likes 3D movies. You know it, I know it, even Stevie Wonder knows it.

      "I was at the cineplex on 795 Paramount Dr, Stoney Creek, ON around 12:27pm Nov.17. I went to the counter and wanted to add more money to my current gift card.  The attendant asked Laura the Assistant Manager on how to do that. Laura replied back and said that the gift card needs to be emptied in order to add more money. Which i believe to know that is incorrect. So Laura wasn't able to help me, so i thought i go to another of their workers and came across Sukhbir, and i mentioned to him that what  i was facing. Sukhbir was surprised on how that i wasn't able to add more money to a gift card. I asked Sukhbir if there is a higher manager i can speak to regarding this matter. He pointed me out to Ryan (manager higher up) i explained to Ryan my situation and he said immediately that it can be done. Ryan and i went to the front counter where Laura was working and Ryan asked on my behalf the same question, Laura repeatedly said that i cannot add more money to a current gift card unless its empty. Ryan said \"lets just try\" and Laura entered it on the till, and what do you know! it worked!, I said right away, \"you all learned something today\"..Something simple as adding more money to a gift card should not have taken so much of my time and headache. Laura (so called assistant manager) needs to be retrained and a refresher on customer service.. Thanks to Ryan for at least trying and getting it done. Also thanks to Sukhbir for his kindness.",
      "Too many commercials. Sure, run 30 minutes of commercials before scheduled start time....that's fine, but then another 20 minutes after scheduled time? Sorry, I'm done with cineplex and silver city. I was enraged, the whole theatre was enraged. Destroyed the movie before it even started."

Walking distance right off of St. George Station. Looking forward to using the the space again this year. It was perfect to be able to have two different films going at the same time throughout this event. And the outdoors added an extra touch for the red carpet feel.",

There\u2019s always something good showing!",

      "This is *the* place to get your motion picture film scanned. Very helpful company too and helped recommend me products.  Just wanted to edit my review, now that I have completed 5-6 Super 8mm cartridges. Their colour correction, communications and education have been invaluable. The team here has helped me learn and grow as an \"artist\". Not only are their scans top notch, but the value beyond that has been amazing. Super 8mm is an expensive medium, and it's not a medium you want to cheap out on in any way. Thanks to this team, my 5th and 6th cartridge produced 3:15 of footage on each one, which is a really high success rate for a new shooter.",
      "Frame Discreet does terrific work!  I've worked with Lianne on two occasions , transferring 16mm to digital video and also Super-8!  She takes the time to explain to you what's happening and gives you all the possible options so you can make your transfer look as good as it can be. I was surprised at how good the transfer from 16 looked and sounded.  I felt very proud when my film was screened in Spain in its new digi version on a big screen!  Thanks FD!",
      "Sent in a 35mm short film from out of town to be transferred to digital and it looked SO GREAT. The team kept in touch when my requested masking needing slight adjustment and sent screen captures so I could make the final call. I couldn't stop talking about how beautiful the file looked!",

The main item was walking up the stairs into the great Hall. The presentation of the trophies and all the hall of fame walls was amazing. The staff members that took my family picture with the cup was great to talk to, as he even knew the Windsor area where we were from. He was talking like he still lives there and how he went to University and watched lots of hockey. It was a great way to experience everything.",
      "I had a blast here, such an awesome Hall of Fame and a true honor to hockey. Has the humble beginnings of hockey from back in the 1890\u2019s, and brings it forward to the last Stanley Cup Champions Colorado Avalanche. Tons of history, not just NHL, but Olympics, Women\u2019s, Minor leagues and international leagues. Loved the summit section, such history there. The mask exhibit was cool with a nice shout to Plante for being the first to insist on a mask. Plenty of things for kids too, interactive shootouts and also goaltending drills. Had a wonderful time and for $20 or so a person it\u2019s a superb value. The gift shop at the end is also nice, nothing outrageously priced.",
      "What an amazing display.  Our game is represented in the most amazing way, as is the international game.  Featured 9 & 99 display was super cool... 2 of the very best ever.  If you like hockey... even a little bit... thisbis worth a stop.  You'll need a couple hours though,  it's a BIG display.",
      "What a cool experience for any hockey fan! Amazing displays, plenty of history and memorabilia. Enjoyed the 9 & 99 featured display, two of the best to ever play the game. You can get your photo taken with the Stanley Cup for a small fee.  Interactive games can get quite busy. There's plenty to see for all ages, I'd budget about 2 hours here as there is a lot to see!",

      "We went to this museum on a weekday and it was still a little busy but still nice. When you\u2019re below 25, you have to register to an annual pass which is free but still takes up a few minutes. The museum in itself was not really my favorite because it had too much of contemporary art which I\u2019m not so fond of. Otherwise, the floor with the miniature boat collection is really nice and the back stairs (accessible from the third and fourth floors) are worth going to admire the view from there. During our visit, there was a nice temporary exhibition which was really nice and intriguing and it seems like they have a nice set of these temp exhibitions !",
      "Where do I even begin?!  I got to the gallery at 3pm, thinking 2.5hrs would be enough time to finish the exhibit. (The gallery closes at 5:30pm)  Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t.  I barely made it through the first floor alone. \ud83d\ude2d will definitely be back though!!  If you can, make a day of it or get the annual pass for an additional $10 (day pass is $25).  In my case, I was only in town for a short visit so didn\u2019t make sense for me to get the annual pass.",
      "A huge 5 level of gallery with amazing arts, models, painting and sculpture by different artists. Every room has a story to tell and one can easily spend an hour just in one section. Make sure to eat well and have ample time with you to visit the gallery. Also, they have a stand where you can keep your coat and bag otherwise if you are carrying a backpack, you have to carry it either on the front or the side but not in the back.  I would recommend to get the tickets online or if you are a member of Toronto Public Library you can avail free passes every Saturday.  Overall, a lovely experience.",
      "Great gallery.  Very pleased at the wide selection of art in the collection, including Canadian art, Indigenous art, and foreign art.  The temporary exhibits are also well done.  It\u2019s also always free for people under 25, which is a great way to get young people involved in the arts!  Tickets should be purchased online in advance even if you are under 25, as you may need to wait for an email confirmation.",
      "I spent approximately four hours in the museum just checking out the ground floor. There were four other levels that I didn't have the time to visit. There's A LOT to see here. It's worth it. Just make sure you have ample time to make the most out of it. There's even a restaurant and a gift shop, so you can pretty much spend most of your day here."

      "I discovered the first Toronto post office was at the heart of Toronto. The exterior itself was a beautiful architecture and well maintained. At first, it looked like a regular building, but when you go inside you submerged into the 1830's. The place was small, but the best museum to visit. You get to use featured ink pen to write your name and sand it off to dry it, as how people used to do. The staffs were very patience and nice, I got traditional seal wax on my postcards, which were unique. A must go place to explore",

There\u2019s also a small mini shop inside as you enter just opposite to Canada post and as you walk in , there\u2019s a mini museum too \u2764\ufe0f",
      "Visited the post office during OpendoorTO, it was packed. It is a small old post office. You could write messages with ink and take them with yourself. They have beautiful maps of the city of Toronto. It is worth a visit!",

      "Visited the Mackenzie House today for a workshop on the printing press. The two ladies who gave the presentation shared incredible insight on the history behind the printing press and our first \u2018rebel mayor.\u2019 They also guided us through the steps in making our own posters and bookmarks which we were able to take home. Overall, a fun while educational experience for the kids and myself.",
      "Even though the main house is closed due to water damage, the hands on \u201ctour\u201d of the printing press and some of storytelling of the newspapers that William Mackenzie printed and distributed was fun. Vanna did a great job - there were only two of us, so it was essentially a private tour. She also talked about others who printed local newspapers, like Mary Ann Shadd, who has quite a story of her own. It was interesting thinking about the process that used to be used to print and communicate.",
      "The staff are very knowledgeable and accommodating. We had a great time!",
      "As a house museum aficionado, I can say this house is extremely well preserved. The tour guide was excellent and provided a ton of great tidbits. My favorite parts were the textiles and the working interior gas lights!",
      "A small but  interesting museum devoted to publisher and first mayor of Toronto William Lyon Mackenzie. The tour guides were very knowledgeable and passionate. I really love their hands on printing experience. Pro tip for Toronto residents: you can get a free pass to historic sites in Toronto from your local Toronto Public Library. Just ask for the MAP pass."

      "A unique, historical and beautiful location in the heart of Toronto. Features include an architecturally significant building dating back to 1829 and beautiful and tranquil gardens with several areas to sit and take in the surroundings. Large wrought iron fences surround the area and cobblestone drives are a wonderful feature. Large trees offer shade and one would not feel as though they are in the heart of a large metropolitan city.",
      "I can't believe I passed by this beautiful place and never realized what it held inside! This building has a gorgeous library and it's full of paintings of past treasurers, each with their own unique touches! There's a dining hall thats been used for over a hundred years with short little seats because people were tinier back then. Come in for a treasure trove of Canadian law history :)",
      "Beautiful hall anyone can get in. Pretty place for pictures. Has a gorgeous library on laws",
      "Was there two years ago and was interested by the historical and architectural building. Especially the Great Library.",
      "Very beautiful from the outside! The trees are absolutely lovely and the old design and floors were a sight to behold. One of the cooler architecture pieces of Toronto as it was designed more than 100 years ago! Definitely a treat to have explored it during doors open Toronto, as it was a great cultural experience and a fun one too! Definitely recommend!"

The movie selections are really good as movies which don't get released elsewhere are present here. Members also get to watch movies for free too and the price of a ticket is also very affordable as well. Definitely make a trip to watch international acclaim movies without fail.",

May is \"Museum  Month\" in the city of Toronto, meaning that you can get into nine city of Toronto-run museums for free with your Toronto library card. Visit here and you will get a terrific view of the St Lawrence Market below.",
      "It's a nice little gallery. They have an exhibition until April 2020 about Street Art and the organization that is behind. And it is free for this particular exhibition. I didn't know where those murals come from. It has been a discovery to know that there is a huge work from the City of Toronto and many artist not only to decorate the city but also to mentor artists at all stages of their development.",

      "Very affordable wedding venue!  Ben who was on site for rehearsal and ceremony was great to work with.  Roxann, great email communication and was lovely meeting her on the day as well!  They have two easels for use, little chalkboards for small signs, and the schoolroom was perfect for a bridal suite - hair & make-up had no problems with their setup and there are four available electrical outlets in the schoolroom.  With the main room close to 150 people, it does get hot in the summer.",
      "We went there during doors open event. It was great to learn the history of the place. They had some old books, toys and articles for display. The volunteers were kind to show us around and give us information too. Neat place for cozy events. Very tidy and well kept property.",
      "Got married at the Enoch Turner this summer. The space is very pretty but the air conditioning cannot really keep up. The acoustics are not great as well and big chunks of the space need to be taken over by the caterers. Would not recommend it for weddings that include dancing of more than 30 people... Staff person was helpful but was dressed very, very casually. It was quite inappropriate. There was tension beyween him and the catering staff.",
      "GREAT experience with this venue. Ben & Roxann are a great team - very communicative and clear on what will/won\u2019t fly for the space. We had ~75 people for a ceremony and sit-down dinner wedding and had an incredible time. It is an excellent downtown location close to everything you would need. We have lots of teachers in our family so this was an immediate yes from both of us for the history aspect alone. We also loved that there was multiple rooms for guests to use throughout the course of the evening (the bar area, the \"big\" room and the schoolhouse).  This venue is a stunning canvas to create the event of your dreams - very DIY friendly. However, it should be made clear this is a historic place first, then an event space as a secondary function. Definitely not for you if you are looking for a full-service venue, everybody is there to help but not to manage your event. Roxann is incredibly good at recommendations for whatever you\u2019re looking for - planners, music, you name it, they\u2019ve got somebody. They have do preferred vendors for catering, DJ and some other services but the options are excellent and can accommodate various budgets. Even better that string lights can be set up by the venue in different configurations for a small fee. A number of tables and chairs are included with the venue; the chairs were recently (mid-2022) upgraded to chiavari style chairs in a dark wood. Would highly recommend this venue as a guest or as a host of an event.",
      "2 weeks before my wedding, The Enoch Turner Schoolhouse began a roofing project. The outside of the venue was a disaster and NO ONE CARED! My credit card was charged without my authorization and all I was given were list of excuses and justifications. Shady business! Buyers Beware!!!"

The museum part is a bunch of neat stuff put into a smaller space then it needs (by museum standards). However I did hear that they will soon be expanding to the main floor of the building in the future. If you're interested in ancient history, rocks, bones, taxidermy like I am, I recommend checking out this place. Beware if you are a collector you'll be enticed to spend more than you were planning to since they have a ton of cool stuff for sale. :)",

      "Lovely oddities museum in downtown Toronto. Admission is free, but donations are encouraged. Very cool selection of interesting items, all with unique stories behind them. They also run a store where you're able to purchase various skulls/bones, museum quality artifacts, trinkets etc. I've purchased many items from them. I've had one issue while ordering in which both items I had purchased off the website were listed as in stock, but they were actually sold out. They were very quick to rectify and went above and beyond in offering store credit towards another purchase, and when the other item I had selected also ended up being sold out, they swapped it out for a much nicer specimen at no extra charge. My favourite museum in Toronto!",
      "Really cool place for people that like strange things! I went there not expecting much, but their museum has tons of cool things (from real voodoos to real skeletons)! The best part for me was the \u201cmuseum guide\u201d (which is also a magician). He spent almost an hour showing me around and telling me about the museum items! You can also buy random things at the shop, like human rib bones for $30. Definitely recommended for people that like oddities and strange things.",

      "Passed by here on a Friday early afternoon (Dec 9, 2022). Currently it's be pay-what-you-can until December 23 to accommodate holiday programming and private events. Usually admission is $10 for adults, half price for youth and seniors, free for 12 and younger. Highly recommend a visit. The staff gave a really detailed tour of the house, its history and other fun tidbits. I had visited during open door events prior to the pandemic and the tour then was a lot less detailed because of the crowd. I'll definitely be on the look out next Christmas for tickets to a Christmas Carol at the museum next year.",
      "Hidden gem to tour a Georgian home in the centre of Toronto. There aren't many left and a lovely museum. The architectural fragments in the yard come from demolished buildings in the area.  The tour guide we had was fantastic! Energy, knowledge, and great storyteller.  Before you start your day, take pause, have a walk through the gardens to centre yourself. It's very calming as it's set back from the street.  Concrete blocks and high rises everywhere else!!",
      "Beautiful Georgian home right in the heart of downtown Toronto, a real look into the past. Our tour guide was fantastic, would go back again, they host really interesting and unique events!",
      "Netflix Canada turned this place into an awesome holiday house with lots of fun things to do. There was free hot chocolate, free donuts, free sugar cookies and free goodie bags with chocolate. You could write a letter to santa and decorate your own ornament. You can also go to all the rooms to take pictures. It was fun. \ud83d\udc4d",
      "I was lucky to be visiting it yesterday on the 10th , I got to see artworks by gord peteran . Great house , learned so much today with the help of guides Sarah and Nishant , if you\u2019re walking around you should def visit the house and see the beautiful Georgian architecture and interiors \u2764\ufe0f  The house was moved in 1970s because of a conflict so has modern extensions to it which is also interesting to watch !"

      "A small museum with lots of potential! (Especially given that the museum does not actually receive funding from the Police Service.) The concept is excellent and I passed by the curator by chance and had a little chat. She is a very friendly and warm person and you could tell she is dedicated to the museum! I enjoyed the interactive features; for example, you could ride on the motorcycle and have your photo taken. However, many of the lights in the gallery were not open/broken, making it difficult to see many of the exhibits/read the descriptions. And as another reviewer pointed out, some of the cases were dusty and the exhibits overall could use some updates. I understanding that it's challenging given the limited funding, so I'm really hoping that the museum receives more funding, as it's really neat to trace the history of a type of service that is so relevant and crucial to our everyday lives. Note that for individual visits, you no longer need to book in advance; just come by during its opening hours and pass through security at the front entrance. The gift shop closed early during my visit (not sure if that's a more long-term hour change), but I'd love to come back to the gift shop and take a look.",
      "Nice little museum and quite interesting. However could do with an update. Uniforms on display could use a dusting. Glass cases give annoying reflections making the text hard to read. Text to several items in such small print it is barely legible. Interactive displays partly broken. No recent items or information. Don\u2019t think it does justice to the work of the Toronto police.",
      "TPS, Pioneers of Canadian Policing. Excellent tour of the museum, very educational.",
      "My wife and I really enjoy visiting museums both large and small. We found what we consider a hidden gem of a museum in downtown Toronto. The Toronto Police Museum is located right in Police Headquarters on College St. This is a small museum but oh so full of the history of the Toronto Police Force from the 1800\u2019s to the present day. We were given a tour of this facility by Norina, a fantastic guide with a deep knowledge of the workings of the Toronto Police.  This museum should be seen by all tourists and residents, for the great service the Police provides us. I am giving this a huge recommendation.",
      "Smooth process at 9am. Really nice and respectful officer's who screened me. Many tellers to choose from, oh my. I had no problems requesting what I needed for employment services and with the correct identification and forms it was smooth crusing! \ud83d\ude0e Then it was off to work on such a hot morning!"

      "2022 March 4\u2605 approximately 25$ or family of 4 for 93$ Off the streets of downtown Toronto you can easily miss this attraction given its narrow storefront and busy juncture.  Enter inside, the service counter serves as both a waiting area and a mini store selling both SWAG, puzzles and optical illusion books. Complimentary coat check is great. Although it's at your own risk, so no valuables should be left.  Once inside there are a myriad of illusions which the pictures really speak for itself.  The museum is divided into two sections. Total space is estimated to be about 5000sq feet of space. Given its size, it isn't really that big but there are a bunch of unique things to see.  Expect to spend about 45 minutes to 1 hour here, though you could spend less if it's not crowded and you fly through the exhibits. Exhibits do change once in a while.  It's worth checking out at least once. Paid street parking or parking lot nearby. Handicap accessible by request.",
      "Museum of Illusion is a fun experience and spot to check out when in Toronto. Lots of cool exhibits throughout the little Museum. Take your camera \ud83d\udcf7 and follow the guides set put to get the Illusion. Fun for all ages. It's a little spot but still took about 1 and 1.5 hours to see each exhibit. Felt the price was reasonable and staff is helpful. Tip ** I purchased my tickets online which meant no waiting.",
      "We came here spontaneously and wow this was such an amazing experience. All of the illusions were amazing. My favorite was the True Self mirror. But honestly your kids and adults alike will absolutely enjoy this place.  Staff was very very kind and helpful.  Parking was a bit weird but right behind this building on George Street there was underground parking for $16 for a few hours. It was convenient when you figured it out.  Highly recommended.",

      "We went to this museum on a weekday and it was still a little busy but still nice. When you\u2019re below 25, you have to register to an annual pass which is free but still takes up a few minutes. The museum in itself was not really my favorite because it had too much of contemporary art which I\u2019m not so fond of. Otherwise, the floor with the miniature boat collection is really nice and the back stairs (accessible from the third and fourth floors) are worth going to admire the view from there. During our visit, there was a nice temporary exhibition which was really nice and intriguing and it seems like they have a nice set of these temp exhibitions !",
      "Where do I even begin?!  I got to the gallery at 3pm, thinking 2.5hrs would be enough time to finish the exhibit. (The gallery closes at 5:30pm)  Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t.  I barely made it through the first floor alone. \ud83d\ude2d will definitely be back though!!  If you can, make a day of it or get the annual pass for an additional $10 (day pass is $25).  In my case, I was only in town for a short visit so didn\u2019t make sense for me to get the annual pass.",
      "A huge 5 level of gallery with amazing arts, models, painting and sculpture by different artists. Every room has a story to tell and one can easily spend an hour just in one section. Make sure to eat well and have ample time with you to visit the gallery. Also, they have a stand where you can keep your coat and bag otherwise if you are carrying a backpack, you have to carry it either on the front or the side but not in the back.  I would recommend to get the tickets online or if you are a member of Toronto Public Library you can avail free passes every Saturday.  Overall, a lovely experience.",
      "Great gallery.  Very pleased at the wide selection of art in the collection, including Canadian art, Indigenous art, and foreign art.  The temporary exhibits are also well done.  It\u2019s also always free for people under 25, which is a great way to get young people involved in the arts!  Tickets should be purchased online in advance even if you are under 25, as you may need to wait for an email confirmation.",
      "I spent approximately four hours in the museum just checking out the ground floor. There were four other levels that I didn't have the time to visit. There's A LOT to see here. It's worth it. Just make sure you have ample time to make the most out of it. There's even a restaurant and a gift shop, so you can pretty much spend most of your day here."

      "Got to experience this museum during Doors Open Toronto and it was brilliant The history of television is quite fascinating and it was really interesting seeing the evolution of it all. Staff were very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Very impressive overall :)",
      "I had never heard of this place, but my dad is a CARP member and mentioned wanting to go here.  What a fascinating collection they have, stepping back in time.  The museum is in the heart of Liberty Village, so it's accessible by transit, or there is street parking nearby.  Although the museum itself is only one large room, we easily spent a couple of hours in there.  There is a guided tour you can take on your phone that explains everything.  But you can also just read the placards they have, as there is a lot of detail.  The collection is displayed beautifully, and the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.  We signed up for the mailing list as I understand that they have a ton of stuff that's still in storage.  They set up other exhibits and change things around once in awhile, so I'd love to see what else they have!",
      "A really great place with one of a kind exhibits. Very interesting if you want to learn about the history of television. They also offer an app which gives additional information about the exhibits and is available in different languages. I even got a personal tour by the staff. The museum is made up of one huge room where you go around in a circle, this may sound small but I spent nearly two hours there. And the 10 dollars a ticket was definitely worth it.  -enthusiastic, helpful staff -Great exhibits -good price",
      "Very nice experience .  Tons of information ..audio guides from you own phone in different languages..  the guy who was working there  was very kind and knowledgeable.   Nice facilities .clean.   Parking close by.    Tons of  TVs from the past .",
      "Great museum! Darryl was super helpful and passionate about the museum. Fascinating collection with amazing information, and the interactive app to guide visitors around the museum was extremely helpful. Highly recommended!"

      "Excellent Museum telling the story of a Fine Regiment of Canadian Infantry and its contributions to our Nation and the world.  The history of this Regiment is the story of the City of Toronto. The windows of the museum even provide a view to the Birthplace of Toronto (Old Fort York).  Learn about The Regiment's noble founding from what is now Ryerson University; the history behind why this Regiment is the only line infantry regiment authorized to wear the Guards uniform (normally worn only by the Guards units in the UK and in Ottawa); its amazing accomplishments in conflict, such as its contributions to Viking Force: Canada's first iteration of Special Operations; its involvement in the Dieppe Raid; and the drive through Holland. Learn about the stories of the Royals who served as Prisoners of War, and how they endured captivity.  Learn about The Regiment's the contributions of its members in warfighting and Peacekeeping operations around the world.  Discover the patriotic story of its founding.  Become familiar with famous members of The Regiment and their contributions, such as Sir Sandford Fleming: the founder of Standard Time and the first Canadian postage stamp; and so on.  Learn why The Royals are truly Toronto's Regiment.  Royals Ready... Aye Ready!!!",

      "Free Ground Floor entry and very reasonable pricing for paid exhibitions on 1st and 2nd floors. A wonderful space, with great original features (those concrete pillars!) And the most sumptuous cafe for pre or post treats.",
      "Great space with contemporary art in a wide range of mediums. The current exhibit has some painting, photography, and sculpture but also includes works which utilize mixed media and interactivity. The museum occupies several floors and I recommend taking the stairs if you can.  There's a restaurant on the main floor but there is also a brewery and a coffee roastery nearby.",
      "MOCA brings regularly rotated contemporary artists from all over the world and brings them to this gorgeous and spacious building! At the moment, there typically is only 3 floors and less than 5 exhibits/artists being featured, but its always awesome and thought provoking works of art! Every first Sunday of the month is free, sponsored by TD, so consider coming on one of those days.  MOCA has come a long way from their small gallery space on Queen West years ago, so we need to celebrate what they have been able to offer and make use of this beautiful space \u2764\ufe0f",
      "Best place to spend Friday afternoon \ud83e\udd29 This location has three floors of Contemporary Art. I would advise you to visit the Shirin Neshat exhibition while it is still ongoing (until July 31 2022)",
      "A nice place to visit. One thing to note before going to the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto is to review their website for the particular exhibition or display that is going on in the week you want to visit else you will be surprised by what you see compared to the art posted by reviewers. For example, during the day I visited, it was the exhibition of THOMAS DEMAND HOUSE OF CARD & MARTIN BOYCE, RIRKRIT TIRAVANIA, CARUSO STJOHN , and this is to run through December 2022. And so if you visit in February, you may not see any of these things."

      "A hidden gem! We were out for a family drive and just happened to turn into this place that we have always just drove past.  Good thing we did! It's an outdoor and indoor historic village, buildings from the late 1880s onwards.  They have building tours; the place is connected to walking trails; and inside the interpretive centre was a free art installation... An interactive one at that!  Washroom facilities are brand new and clean. Outside, there were brand new info plaques that even had a few audio nuggets to drop... Very cool! It's someplace that we will drop by once or twice a year to see what new installations they have on, and catch a tour!",
      "Good place to walk around and get some fresh air. Nice area for a for walk. Interesting heritage site in the city. Many displays that had interactive speakers, now broken, need to be fixed. Current display canoes very interesting.",
      "We visited for a tree-focused tour of the Wildflower reserve, led by conservationist Steve Smith. Fascinating to see the space through the eyes of the folks who built it, plant by plant by plant. The paths (out the South end of the parking areas) are worth the stroll for the birds and native bio diversity on view, even without the guide!",
      "Walk the Don: Lower Don Trail ' Pottery Road (Todmorden Mills) to Cherry Street (Distillery District)  The Lower Don Trail is from Pottery Road to Cherry Street at the Distillery District, a total of 6 km.  Glad to see that the City of Toronto is investing on recreational trails.  The kilometer markers were new and the Corktown Common was likewise a recent development.  I was under the Prince Edward Viaduct and could see the subway crossing the viaduct.  When I am on the subway and passing by the viaduct and looking down, I could see the trail and the Don Valley Parkway to my right and Bayview Avenue to my left (when the train is going  The end of the trail was the Distillery District.",
      "Visited the site in early October, 2022. A great (and free!) site/museum to learn about a neat, hidden piece of Toronto's history! This is a place that so many people pass by unknowingly on the DVP, so it's great to get to know the site and its impacts on the city's development. I especially liked stepping into the homes. They were very well preserved and have very cool artefacts/replicas, such as antique cash, TTC transfers, and what bathtubs (if you could call it so) used to look like. The grounds are also quite nice for a walk; you could take a short loop around the museum. I even spotted a blue heron! Would encourage more people to come and visit. Plus, you could walk from here to/from Evergreen Brick Works to make it a longer outing."

      "This was a great experience... very cool castle estate. Gardens were cool. Historical write-ups for the rooms, a horse stable, antique car museum, and a Back Stage Celebrities walk, which has little scenes with (wax?) statues and clips playing for all of the movies that were recorded at the castle. Loved it! I wasn't quite as excited about the 3rd floor, but if you are into military history, you would love it. Getting up to the tower was awesome, too.",
      "Truly a beautiful space! It's a Gothic Revival style mansion and house museum with beautiful grounds during the summer. I can imagine weddings at this place! To get to the highest levels you have to take some very narrow stairs and if you are able to, it's totally worth going to the top. You will see amazing views of the surrounding areas! Can't wait to return here someday when things are back to normal, or as close to normal as possible!",
      "The place was amazing. Last time that I was in here was when I was a child. Everything changed a lot! The guy at the front collecting tickets was super nice! And answered all our questions.  Our favorite was getting to climb the stairs all the way to the top floor! We wish the secret garden was open. I heard lots of good things about it. We also loved the celebrity rooms.  It keeps on running through my mind on what if Casa loma did an overnight thing where they turn off all the lights and everyone used a flashlight. That will be amazing. Maybe do this for Halloween?  We will be back for sure!",
      "When visiting Toronto don\u2019t miss the opportunity to visit this beautiful castle. The grounds and fountains and gardens are beautiful. So much elegance and history is packed in each room. This castle was really interesting and fun to explore. There are plenty of places to relax and just take in the views. It\u2019s like a museum but more engaging and fun. Apparently they have a Halloween show but my visit was before then. I bet this place looks fabulous decked out for Christmas .",
      "More than the castle and its architecture, I enjoyed the history of the castle presented in a documentary movie in the basement. So, be sure to check that out which is included in your ticket. Another perk is that you get audio guide devices which were very cool. The ones that we got did not have headphones so you had to hold them like you are speaking on the phone, but I saw some other people with devices having headphones. The most enjoyable part of the experience was that there are 2 towers that you had to climb very narrow stairs to reach the top. They were decorated and designed for escape room game purposes which was fun to see. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience."

      "It is absolutely amazing, you can spend a whole day in the museum. It has different sections of historical ages from all over the world. You can see many things from different civilizations. I loved the geology part. You can find brilliant minerals and stones. It is one of the best museum I have ever seen. Highly recommended to visit.",
      "The ROM is World Class, all the way! Better then any of the Smithsonian in Washington DC. It is really a natural history and art & culture museum rolled into one! I only spent a few hours here, however you could come here for days and still be able to take in everything. I would recommend visiting the museum website in advance and prioritize what collections you want to see. Some rooms are going to be more busy then others based on the content. Lots of child friendly exhibits, ask the curators as to which ones are best suited for children. I bought the city pass in advance. NOTE: For the city pass the museum does require you to pick a day of visitation in advance. The city pass made it easy to access the museum. I recommend a visit to the geology collection. Some of the biggest geodes I have ever seen!",
      "Clean and organized. Big and spacious museum. The dinosaur floor is a win for the kids and the most packed. In other floors/exhibits, Not so much of the Displays are so archaic but still worth a visit.. The artist's exhibition is also a nice one, they help in introducing promising artists. We enjoyed our visit. We enjoyed it. There\u2019s so many things to see at the ROM. We had less than 2 hours before closing, and wish we had more time. Each floor is full of amazing artifacts! Very informative, quick lines to get in, and worth visiting - especially with the CITY PASS. We will be back!",
      "ROM has an amazing collection. Every section you go seems better than the previous. Even if you have specific interests you can't help but appreciate others. If one wants to take a glimpse at every exhibit it can easily take 3 hours to complete the museum. But if one really wants to examine and learn they can spend the whole day in one section",
      "A day well spent at the ROM, from the Dinosaurs display to the Bats cave, from learning about the ancient to modern history of the World. The museum is large with pretty nice interiors and well-displayed artifacts; my favourites were the Minerals and Precious stones section. The staff was also polite and helpful. One thing I would suggest is that they should increase the closing time from 5:30 to 7 PM. Overall it's a nice place to spend the day."

      "I was able to visit this place as a part of Doors Open Toronto. The house is fantastic - they've done a wonderful job maintaining the historical finishes inside - to match the photos that exist.  There was staff in every room, explaining details about the house. They had a video playing in the basement that went into even more detail.  The grounds are even more stunning. They had little games like they would have been playing in the 1800s. The trees were flowering(!!!), the gardens were perfect... It was breathtaking.",
      "I really liked this museum. Excellent preservation of the home with very knowledgeable guides to take you on a tour of each room. There\u2019s also the beautiful, really well-maintained grounds where you can grab a drink, do some reading or just sit and soak in the peace and quiet.

      "It's an OK museum. It won't take too long to finish unless you are checking the design of each shoe. It kind of gives an idea of how shoes evolved and also what's the future design may look like. We definitely found some interesting shoes that showed creativity. Don't forget to take the Match it game cards to make your walk through interesting. Honestly, it felt like the cost is a bit high for the size and shows of the museum.",
      "Superbly laid out museum. Very structured and shows the entire history of shoes intertwined with world history, which makes for great reading, not boring at all. 5 floors of exhibits. Start from the basement which is fascinating. Can easily spend two hours here going through the loads of displays and attached descriptions.",
      "A hidden gem a block over from the Royal Ontario Museum. Learn history and the history of shoes. Designer shoes-check, shoes for dolls-check, shoes for celebrities and royals-check. Some amazing historical facts are also presented in great detail and keeping in mind the sensitive nature of some of the topics. Kids can have fun trying to find the different images in a scavenger hunt, paint a shoe and even try out different styles of shoes. Overall a unique experience that will surprise you.",
      "One of my favourite museums in all of Toronto. Their exhibits are apparently always changing so I\u2019ll have to come back but just really cool learning about the history of footwear and all the evolutions of it in different cultures. Also it\u2019s free on Sundays right now so don\u2019t miss out.",
      "The Bata Shoe Museum was ok, but a bit underwhelming. It\u2019s $14/adult to enter. You enter on the 1st floor but have to go to the ground floor to get started. Then climb each floor to see the rest of the museum. I wish it was the other way around so you can take the elevator up and then walk downstairs.  The ground floor exhibit was interesting. It talks about the history of shoes throughout generations and by cultures. Each example had 1-3 shoes.  There was a small exhibit about dolls and breaking barriers which was neat, not not really about shoes.  The top floor exhibit was beautiful, but didn\u2019t make sense and didn\u2019t offer a lot. One part of the museum was closed.  What I wanted to see was more modern examples of shoes throughout generations. I wanted to see more \u201cfamous shoes\u201d from celebrities or significant moments in time. Apparently the museum has a huge collection of shoes. I wish the ground floor exhibit was more robust."

      "Back in the 1800's in what was then known as Upper Canada, private companies were contracted to build, improve and maintain roads, in return for which they were permitted to collect tolls from users. This museum represents such a cottage. It is a lovely small place that has friendly volunteer staff.",
      "In the 19th century small tollkeeper's cottages were built to house tollkeepers who collected tolls on the roads that lead into the city later known as Toronto, Ontario. Private companies were licensed to maintain the province's roads, and they were allowed to levy tolls from those traveling on the road to pay for that maintenance. Tollkeepers were provided with cottages, so they could work from home.  The first tollkeeper's cottage was built in 1820, at the corner of Yonge and King streets, when that intersection was on the outskirts of York, Upper Canada. The tollkeeper system was retired in 1896.  In 1993 what had been tollhouse number 3, one of five tollhouses on Davenport Road was rediscovered. It had been moved, and repurposed, and was about to be demolished. After a long period of restoration it was turned into a museum, and turned into the centerpiece of a park, near its original location, at the corner of Davenport Road and Bathurst Street.  John Allemang, writing in The Globe and Mail, contrasted the poverty of working class citizens, as documented by the cottage, to the luxury of the rich, as documented by two nearby former mansions, Casa Loma and Spadina House, now open to the public. Allemang wrote:  For visitors not entranced by the history of tolls or roads, by the lost stories of the city's French roots, or the shameful betrayals of the Mississauga Indians who once lived here, the cottage can offer up a revealing picture of lower-class existence in 19th-century Toronto. If Casa Loma and Spadina House on the brow of the escarpment represent the aristocratic Upstairs, the tollkeeper's three-room house, with unheated bedrooms where children would sleep three to a bed, is all too clearly Downstairs.",
      "The attention to detail is brilliant! The bedsheets are made of men\u2019s suits. It\u2019s the kind of stuff a lot of history books pass over.",
      "Very nice pleasant place to visit. Very kind and knowledgeable staff. I helped found the cottage with my mother originally. They were very receptive to that.",

      "This could have been a really good experience but unfortunately because of one artist\u2019s ignorance about mental health ruined everything for us. My son has been hospitalized with his mental health issues. But finally he was discharged a week ago and since he\u2019s very artistic himself  I brought him to see this place. While we were admiring and enjoying all the art work he started commenting about this picture and went in his delusional state and started talking about who created that painting which wasn\u2019t the name on the painting. Unfortunately that artist was right there and it seemed like he took it extremely personally. That artist took his wallet out and started showing my son his Id\u2019s and credit cards and drivers licence to prove this is created by him in a loud and angry tone of voice. My son was in shock and still in his delusional  space and my son felt so confused and embarrassed. At that time my heart as a mother just broke into million pieces. My son couldn\u2019t even stand. I offered my shoulder for my son to stay up. He held on to me and we had to get out of there right away.  This person rudely interrupted our private conversation and ruined our a potentially beautiful day just for his own insecurities I wish u weren\u2019t there to spoil our fun day. If u weren\u2019t there my son and I could have a memorable day. U r a terrible person to do this. I wish I would have never brought my son to this place. \ud83d\ude2d U had no business to intrude in our private conversation. Yet u took it and made it to your business.",
      "Bought a piece of Mr. Brainwash art from Taglialatella at the Art Toronto Convention. Mackenzie and her partner were amazing to work with, sent me my receipt in a timely manner and kept me in the loop when my painting was ready to be picked up. Would recommend this gallery to anyone looking for a modern and unique piece, they have a great mix of Canadian and global artists!",
      "Stumbled upon this pop-up gallery filled with Pop art works of Mr. Brainwash. Stepped into a world of iconic works of mixed mediums and elements in a very well spaced out show space that was comfortable in current times to walk through and view. The paper, sculptures were quite unique along with the various pop-art works showcasing Marilyn Monroe wearing mask was very chic and relative to our time. Jimmy Hendrik piece was a home run. I do hope this showcase gets to be seen.",

Every first Sunday of the month is free, sponsored by TD, so consider coming on one of those days.  MOCA has come a long way from their small gallery space on Queen West years ago, so we need to celebrate what they have been able to offer and make use of this beautiful space \u2764\ufe0f",
      "Best place to spend Friday afternoon \ud83e\udd29 This location has three floors of Contemporary Art. I would advise you to visit the Shirin Neshat exhibition while it is still ongoing (until July 31 2022)",
      "A nice place to visit. One thing to note before going to the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto is to review their website for the particular exhibition or display that is going on in the week you want to visit else you will be surprised by what you see compared to the art posted by reviewers. For example, during the day I visited, it was the exhibition of THOMAS DEMAND HOUSE OF CARD & MARTIN BOYCE, RIRKRIT TIRAVANIA, CARUSO STJOHN , and this is to run through December 2022. And so if you visit in February, you may not see any of these things."

This website will compare hundreds of hotel sites and typically will have rooms much cheaper compared to others! Thank me later! This resort is the best rated in this area. I've been coming here for a long time. If you stay for a few nights you definitely will love it I'm sure!  Great place for live music, and amazing seats to view the band as well. Food servings were surprisingly filling and staff were amazing. Can\u2019t go wrong coming here for a good time.",
      "I stayed one night recently. The Rex was awesome in every way. Extremely clean, friendly and willing to please. Room was small but it cost one third of next cheapest hotel in area. Parking next door was only $25 for 24 hours so we parked it and enjoyed the great neighborhood.  Food and jazz band was great part of trip! Mike was helpful on desk..all aspects were great beyond expectations!!",
      "Beautiful old timely diner with an open mic stage. Good audience and drinks. Best to go with your friends or family. Lovely staff and service. Polite and quiet people who love jazz blues and acoustic. I loved this place I'd come back with a date. Good if you love old timey and vintage.",
      "The Rex Hotel Jazz and Blues Bar are located at the heart of Toronto Downtown. This place defines a 'cozy place.' The music started at 8.30 PM, as they mentioned on the ticket.  We bought a ticket for Roberto Occhipinti Quartet. We preferred to sit in the bar section, which was very influential in comparing the price and quality.  I can suggest buying a ticket from the bar section. you can see the main scene, don't worry. To have the best personal music listening experience, my advice is to go with a maximum of 2 people. You can even feel meditating on the music while you go alone and sip your drink. Rex Jazz and Blues Bar are highly recommended if you want to give yourself a relaxing night experience. Prices are fair; you must wait a while to deliver your order. That is the only negative side. Overall good experience.",
      "The steak and sweet potato fries are amazing, the atmosphere is terrific, the service is nice, friendly, and timely. Its just small enough to feel cozy but not cramped. The drinks are a bit pricy but the food makes up for it! They host some amazing musicians I highly recommend it!"

      "3.5/5 First time here for lunch on a Friday and it was a lovely setting with friendly service. The server was continually topping up our glasses of water & wine. The fish and chips was tasty but had just an extra amount of salt. The bolognese was disappointing as it tasted like a freezer made one with better presentation. For the price it was fine but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d return.",
      "The staff was very friendly and attentive. It was a pretty laid back environment. I had the impossible smash burger which was good. The drinks were good as well. I would have only wished the drinks were slightly larger same with the burger. All in all a pretty good experience. It is a good place to try if you are in the area.",

      "The service was great. Everything was quick. We did also order the tempura shrimp, I forgot to take a photo bc I was so hungry, that was overpriced and it wasn\u2019t real shrimp tempura.. more like a spring roll type crust. Still good"

      "A true Toronto gem. Easily the best jazz bar in town. What a true jazz bar is meant to be, intimate, unpretentious, all about the music. Still one of my favourites hangs and one of the nest spots in town for live performances. Get the sliders when you're there, they are heavenly!!",
      "It's a really nice place to go out for a date. The music is good if you like jazz. We went there on a  Saturday night. The sliders were nothing special but the appetizer with the wild mushrooms on bread was really good. We had to pay a $15 cover charge each to get in. Normally I would give three stars but because of the service and the band Ill give a 4.",
      "The food was delicious, the music and the atmosphere was amazing. It was little bit crowded for post COVID. It has a $15 entrance fee. I recommend to make a reservation if you like to sit down. If not, by around 11, some of the seats will be empty, you may be able to sit on those. We went there on Friday night and Alison Young and her band were amazing.",
      "We had one of the best nights here!!! The live band was amazing and the food delicious !! You need to try the Wild Mushroom Devil Toast! Great time at a great price! You should make a reservation if you want a table. If not, you can drop by and stand around the bar.",
      "A lovely way to enjoy some blues and some jazz! Our server (and the owner) were so kind\u2014it made our experience that much more special.  The cocktails are expensive, but delicious. The food is also so good\u2014I got the mushroom pizza and it was perfection. The vibe is the reason to go; it\u2019s very chill and has some wonderful music. We suggest going to dinner so that you have the table for the entire night."

The foods is good and comes out at an appropriate time so it's noce and hot.  They have a good martini menu full of interesting flavours, they can also substitute if needed.  They have a live DJ every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, with a different DJ every night.  Very funny for birthday parties, corporate events.",

      "Terrible and unsafe.  Went for New Years Eve, which was supposed to be a ticketed event. Purchased 6 tickets on club crawlers before and got to the club around 11. Line was on wrongside and wasted 20 minutes after they made everyone shift to the other side. Bought tickets thinking that it would be better than a place which was open access and could get crowded. But in line they were letting mostly everyone in (with and without tickets) and the place was filled to the point that you couldn't move freely upstairs. People were packed so tightly that it was definitely a fire/stampede risk environment and certain men took advantage of the zero personal space situation (grabbing and touching my female friends and I inappropriately). Coat check was full so we had to carry our jackets and we wasted time after midnight waiting for drinks downstairs that we never got because they ran out of glasses. Bought two shots of rum at the other bar upstairs for $15 and left asap when it reached the most crowded that you couldn't even dance or breathe.  Overall, it was a horrible first experience at bar 244 and hated the hour we spent there. They were still letting people in as we left. Extremely unsafe environment and do not recommend women to go here, especially for NYE.",
      "It used to be $3 all night, every night for bar rail, which is reasonable (cause honestly, bar rail is bottom of the barrel). Went tonight and Bud Light was $9.25, like.. are you serious? lol. Also, the downstairs club (one of the best parts) doesn't even open anymore??? The best club to go to years ago, and now they've sold out for expensive drinks, and shoving people in the top, and small, space. Lame. Won't go back.  Edit: I will say, 244 used to be my regular place, I loved it. Sure, no cover but if you made a guestlist and showed up before 11pm, you wouldn't have to pay cover anyway. I would have happily paid ten bucks for things to be at least a little similar to how it used to be, what made the place so great. Bartenders told us ALL beer was the same price, which contradicts what is said below.",
      "drinks not even that cheap. worst dj ever - playing constant jamaican songs. overselling tickets and creating a dangerous environment. one loud muffled speaker upstairs and thats it.. really need to renovate the place.",
      "This is a local watering hole with a dance club downstairs. Upstairs there is no cover with music. Good service at the bar.",
      "Nice place -opens after 9 and crowd comes in after 11 -experienced both the non crowded and crowded moments -fun all through! No food -just a bar and dance joint though most nights the underground part is closed ..great bar tenders-parth served us well and the ladies were all smiles too all night despite the crowd"

      "After the Club Q shootings in The USA, I appreciate our safe Queer spaces in Canada. Buddies gives us quality theatre, performance art & entertainment for diverse Queer audiences and I appreciate it more than ever after 4 decades. It is such an important community hub.",
      "Lovely folks had such a great time also felt safe there going to the bathroom since it was a super nice all genders restroom which rarely get at venues  super stoked to go to an event there again!!!!",
      "New management is terrible. Incompetent, difficult to deal with, certainly not customer-service oriented. Not an exaggeration to characterize them as borderline hostile to rental clients. Something needs to change",
      "So disappointed! First, the place looks old. Besides of that, music was not good, very few people there, but the worst thing was the drinks. They gave me a beer with a lemon and a long hair inside the lemon \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e we stayed there for one hour or so.",
      "I normally go to Buddies once a month for the Throb Party. Last Saturday (June 11) I waited in line for a drink for almost 50 minutes. Missing 1/3 of my time there trying to have fun in line while other people just cut the line and get served first. Just two bartenders working on their own time. My suggestion is or hiring more staff or sell drink tickets at the entrance so the bartenders don\u2019t have to waste time computing the sales. Don\u2019t understand me wrong, I love going there but there\u2019s no organization by the staff, I work as a bartender and waiting for that much for a drink at a party with less than 200 people is an absolute mess."

      "Has Cake tried playing good music? There\u2019s a reason there\u2019s a total of 10 people in the building all sitting on the couches\u2026 Also, why are 2 drinks $40? Go elsewhere!!",
      "Didn't let me in. Said I was too ugly. Jokes on them, I was just looking for the McDonald's. They also said I could use some work but at least I got my nuggets.",
      "It is a cute club but the music selection could definitely be better. Definitely for more of a younger crowd. We were harassed by the bartender for not tipping even though we didn\u2019t have cash on us nor was there an available ATM at the time? The club was packed Im sure we did not put a dent in his pockets. It was a dumbfounding experience after that I will admit.",
      "One of our favourite clubs, my friends and I are here almost every weekend! The bouncers are always super nice, which makes for a great start to the night. Haven\u2019t met friendlier bouncers anywhere else. The owner is also great, very involved and attentive. He\u2019s always there and takes the time & effort to resolve any issues. Great price for drinks too, $3!!",
      "Went here for my birthday and got a booth and bottle service. Had an absolutely amazing night! The staff is extremely friendly and the music was great! The bottles are also very fairly priced compared to other clubs in Toronto that charge way too much. 10/10 experience here!"

      "The performers are really great and the staff were very nice to us. Going on a less busy night such as a Wednesday will give you the opportunity to see more and be up close without a big crowd. There was no line up outside so it's great because we got to just get in and enjoy the show right away! I did not take any photos of the performers even though they were great because I didn't know what the content policy was on photos. But definitely recommended especially on a less busy night! The entrance is stairs so it's definitely not an accessible space but for those who can, it's worth it. Halloween decor was on point!",
      "We went here for my friend's birthday! We really enjoyed the performances and whole night. I do recommend it and probably will be back some years later. The show was entertaining.  Things to improve: cleanness and payment method which is cash-only. They have an ATM inside but I prefer using my credit card. The price seems reasonable. Our table was great but some seats are farther and have hard time to see the scene. Many columns block the stage.",
      "Come for a drag show, don\u2019t stay for the alcohol or dancing. The queens are always fun to watch (if you can find a spot that\u2019s not behind a poll\u2026) but drinks are really ridiculously overpriced and the sounds system for the dance floor is completely shot. The club is also super run down, like for price of cover and the alcohol they charge you\u2019d think they could make the space a little\u2026spacious\u2026and a little more modern.",
      "My first time at Crews and Tango. It is cash only, and sure, it looks a little rundown I side but that's the atmosphere. Drinks are on the expensive side. The performances are great, though.  What I will say is the staff is amazing. It's not often I feel uncomfortable but there was one guy who immediately gave me bad vibes and a few others commented on it. I asked the bartender to keep an eye on him and he was eventually escorted out by security. Made a few of us feel much safer.",
      "Always love going to Crews, but the vibe has definitely changed in the last 2-3 years.. They should incorporate different drag queens and more of a diverse set list. Some nights the shows get repetitive so I don\u2019t frequent as often as I used to. Still got Love for Crews though but mix it up a bit."

      "Nice atmosphere. Artists bring the crowd. However low A/C and ine bartender thought they were slick and didn't give me my change. Common ethics to always return that. This is the real reason why I made this review. Sorry lady, you shouldn't have thought I was intoxicated.",
      "Great music nice outdoor patio even on a chilly night. Loved the intimate setting inside. Staff inside not friendly no smiles from anyone. Bouncers we\u2019re nice outside. May try it again.",
      "We came here for a party with friends and it was great! Music was awesome while the place wasn\u2019t packed at all. Then we tried to book a table on our own and didn\u2019t get a response for a week! Their Instagram says \u201cdm to reserve a table\u201d. I dm\u2019ed and got a quick response that someone will reach out via email. Nothing. I followed up and got the same response. Still nothing. Then I sent an email to them instead of waiting for them to reach out to me. A few days later, the night before the party (!), I finally receive a templated email which I had to wait for a week?!! At that point, we already had other plans. It was a very unprofessional treatment from the Booking Manager. If the business says \u201cdt to book a table\u201d then be respectful to actually timely book your customers and not make them wait for a week. As much as I liked my first visit and wanted to introduce more friends to Parlour270, this unprofessional experience just ruined it all.",
      "I visited this business with my wife for a drink for our anniversary.  I accidentally hit with my shoulder another guest while dancing and apologized for it. As a surprise he brought the bouncer and asked him to kick me out. The guest started grabbing me  from my hands basically wanted to fight  with me  while the bouncer being present and not doing anything I was forced  to leave so I didn't make a scene in front of my wife.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL",
      "I went to this place only once. The interior design is very good and stunning. They have two big hall and patio as well. Their music is not the best and it wasn\u2019t my taste and I was wondering with playing good songs this place can be amazing for Friday/Saturday night. We got bottle service and it was pretty pricy. I think this place is good for having parties and they do that too, because when we were there it was a group of people getting ready for birthday party."

Super neat spot but a little hard to have a conversation, but that\u2019s Friday night at a bar in Toronto for you. The cocktail I had was great and the service was prompt and friendly.",

The bar itself is unique and it\u2019s decor is really cool. Would definitely return. Can\u2019t speak to the food though as we only had cocktails.",

      "It's dark. Even the bathroom is dark. Small menu. Ordered the prime rib burgers and I truly haven't had a burger that good since Mike's Fish and Chips on Eg West shut down like 50 years ago.  My son had a smoke and mirrors cocktail and really enjoyed it.  He also had a ginger beer, which I tried and it was really refreshing.  Back to the burgers, very simply dressed, bun had a crispy edge. Can't wait to go back for another. Service was friendly and efficient.  Go early if you want a table."

      "What an experience!!!  My girlfriend and I were walking back to downtown from the distillery district and stumbled upon On The Rocks. We were only planning to grab one drink before seeing a show at Meridian Hall, but we enjoyed our time here so much that we came back after the show. Jay at OTR went out of his way to make our experience memorable - thank you Jay! If we lived here, this would be our regular - lots of food options, ice cold beer on tap, and a hidden gem. It looked like there was a dope patio out back too- noted for warmer summer nights. There is karaoke on Saturday nights (maybe others too) and it was a fun crowd of all ages that came out. A great time!",

      "I've come here twice so far with my dance class, mainly for the karaoke. They've been very accommodating for our groups, and the deposit I put all goes towards food, and I get a bunch of apps for the tables- I like their fries, the sweet chilli shrimp, and the crispy calamari. We have a great time every time, and we'll definitely be back!",
      "Food was great we had YPT soup (a meal in itself), wings which were perfectly cooked with great fries. The service was excellent, thanks J. Not a fan of karaoke so he opened the patio for us. We'd go back for sure.",

Food and drinks were tasty.. but no variety for non alcoholic guests! Dry cocktails are so limited Food is nice tasty but took too long to arrive i had to remind the waiter twice actually. I didnt like the bartender with the braids though..not very friendly...focusing on one side rather than all guests sitting at the bar Food arrived very late we asked for burgers without bacon on top. It came one hour late and with bacon! They had to send it back to the kitchen  & replace it... I would visit again..i liked the atmosphere though..price is okay.",

They have a great lineup of weekend and late night events and it\u2019s a great vibe!",
      "Everything here was really good. From the food, cleanness, staff, drinks, ambiance! We had the the Jack Daniel\u2019s and Kiss me I\u2019m Irish whisky flights and I was very pleased to know that the servings sizes were very generous! I\u2019ll recommend for both big and intimate events, birthdays etc",

To top all that , everyone who worked there was very friendly and welcoming. The tunnel tour was very informative. There is a whiskey for everyone from all around the world!! All in all, you get what you pay for... and thats a damn good time !!",
      "Hands down one of the best lounges in Downtown Toronto for the service, ambiance, and price point! The lounge is 25+ and dress code is dressy.  CC lounge is a great place to go clubbing at if you\u2019re looking for a club with actual service and a more upscale experience. It has the perfect amount of crowd but is not packed like sardines, which I really appreciate, unlike some clubs where you\u2019re constantly being shoved around a sea of sweaty people.  I booked bottle service here 3 times this year and every time has been a great experience. The price point was a lot cheaper than other hyped clubs in Downtown Toronto, the service was superior, and you actually get treated like VIP (unlike many other Toronto clubs where you throw down a few grand and still get treated like a peasant). If you book a booth they also give a bracelet for unlimited bar rail drinks to the person celebrating that night or whoever booked the booth. The bracelet is good for that night only and you can have as many drinks as you want through your server. A free food platter is also provided to the table around midnight, the food is actually really good and consist of sliders, grilled cheese, and fries.  CC lounge is definitely a hidden gem! If you\u2019re looking for fairly priced bottle service, and a great clubbing experience with actual service then this is the place! It\u2019s also located near union station for those who are commuting into Toronto to party."

      "Summerlicious menu was decent, but service was not. Painfully slow and inattentive, food arrived before drinks (and only two other tables occupied!). Although I commend the all-gender restrooms, can't say I enjoy wading through urine. Wish the experience was better.",
      "We came here for winterlicious, which was somewhat overpriced. The service here is terrible. We were not offered water when we sat and had to ask for it. The server told us several items which we were looking forward to, were unavailable, but tables after us were able to order those \"unavailable\" items. The water was refilled very few times, and we had to wait a long while in order for the table to be cleared and for each dish to come. It was also difficult getting the bill, we were done for almost half an hour before the bill came.  The food itself was not bad, the presentation was good for the butternut squash puree, beef papardelle, and desserts, but it was nothing special. A horrible experience for the price, especially given the non-existent service.",
      "Booked Stages 2 hours prior to a show at Massey Hall - it's a very small place inside the Pantages Hotel and there were still a few open tables.  Unfortunately Management seems to think that having ONE disinterested employee to work the bar, wait the tables, bus the tables and attend to all the guests' needs is sufficient.  It's not.  At all. but this evening was so ridiculous it was comical  15 mins after being seated we still didn't even have water or menus 20 mins in we get menus and order drinks 30 mins we order our options from the small set menu 50 mins in the wrong appetizers arrived (we ordered soup he brought hummus) 55 mins - he brings one soup and one hummus (again!) (BOTH were supposed to be soup hence why we sent the hummus back...we repeat the full order.  Again.) 65 mins - the other soup arrives.  We specifically repeat our mains option and the dessert option and tell him to bring everything together 85 mins - he brings 2 pasta entrees...one was correct the other was supposed to be salmon (even though we JUST repeated the order AGAIN 20 mins prior) he said he'll be right back with the salmon 95 mins - he comes with dessert and the bill...NO ENTREE WITH HIM!! He says he \"FORGOT\" 100 mins - comes back and says the kitchen can't make the salmon in time, he also says he cannot get us hot water, or coffee to go with this dessert (which is about to be my Mother's main meal)  Over a span of 1 hour and 50 minutes they were not able to provide a very simple set menu to a table of 2 people.  When we left there was no one else there.  HOW DOES ONE SCREW UP SO BADLY OVER 2 HOURS?? Now the server himself was also obviously not that concerned with getting things right after the first mess up as he didn't even write anything down. By far the WORST and MOST RIDICULOUS experience I've ever had, anywhere. Just Shameful.",

      "It was our first time visiting the Jazz Bistro, and we had a really great experience! Loved the cozy atmosphere and the food was delicious too. The roasted chicken with gnocchi was so tasty and my husband loved his burger. I requested a cocktail menu and was informed they were in the process of updating it. Quality cocktails would definitely add to the amazing vibe of this place. R\u00e9mi Bolduc and the band were fantastic and the sound was perfect! I appreciated that they requested no talking during the performances but unfortunately the two young women sitting beside us talked the entire time. They obviously weren't there for the Jazz, but we did not let that take away from the enjoyment of our evening. After 2 years, it was gift to have an evening of live music at The Jazz Bistro!\ud83c\udfb6",
      "Saw Wild Blue Herons live here, they were incredible! Beautiful venue, great food and service. About $30-40 for main course, wine starting at about $50 a bottle. Menu is small but we'll executed. Acoustics are great, seating done well so everyone can see and hear properly (not a given in a music club, sadly). Staff are very lovely.",
      "Was an amazing time! Went on a first date here, the atmosphere was really relaxing, great jazz trio playing while having a nice tasty dinner. Had the rigatoni and it was well done. It was hard to find parking nearby so anyone who needs to park I recommend coming a bit early to find parking. I was also able to use Open Table to book our reservation.  Will definitely come back again one night soon",
      "The Jazz bistro is a fantastic place for jazz lovers and a hidden gem in Toronto's busy entertainment vibe. They perform both on main level and 3rd floor and have a nice semi open patio upstairs. Going back there after 4 years, the quality of service and food is still outstanding. The performance of the band (Club 350), jamming was astonishing.",
      "Sooo we went to the Jazz Bistro to celebrate my mothers birthday. The service was impeccable our host for the evening Veronica was amazing and helpful made everything super easy. I just have a couple little issues, the food was good but for the amount you pay not worth it. $20 for 2 pieces of braised beef, 41.99 for rack of lamb that came with 3 pieces not 4 also should have came with somthing like wild rice or something I get the dishes were to be upscale but they should also be filling. We had to pay for bread which is normally free everywhere else. We also paid the entertainment fee which was well worth it, however we we decided to move upstairs for the late night session we were going to be charged again for an entertainment fee. I feel as if we paid once we should have to pay again especially if we will be buying drinks etc... However all in all we enjoyed ourselves the taste of the food was great and again service was amazing."

      "Amazing staff, drinks and food. First ever place that made drinks with good amount of alcohol for the money they charge. Food was very tasty and the staff were very friendly. We visited the vault downstairs and its a must see. It\u2019s so nice to see age old vault still intact.",
      "Amazing experience! I sat at the bar on a weekend evening and the bartender Brooke provided excellence service. She always ensured I had a drink, and a water. Brooke made fantastic cocktails, both from the menu and free- hand when I requested she made me a surprise drink. Will definitely return- thanks Brooke!",
      "One King West is the story of a teller and a vault.  Historic location. Don't forget the elephants.  Good Burger too",
      "This bar is situated in the corner with tables sprawled around the lobby. The food is your usual bar food on pretty plates. Over cheesed pizza, wings and sweet potatoe fries are of your average bar variety. Brownie feels like it's a microwaved one topped with ice cream. Does the job if you're in a pinch.  Drinks: Around 6 beers on tap with a good variety of cocktails. Salted caramel apple and the pineapple melon splash are both excellent choices.  Service: great service given the number of tables to server ratio.  Long story short, I would stop here again for drinks but the food is nothing to write home about.",
      "Entrance is provided in the second picture! They don\u2019t say or mention but you must go and seat yourself And you will be met with a waiter or waitress shortly which are very friendly and attentive! -I order the Korean bbq ribs and they were honestly 10/10 a must recommend, dont shy away from the price since you do get 6pieces with a small amount of vegetables and rice and I\u2019m a big eater and it filled me up nicely! -Menu is QR scanned or you have to ask for the Physical menu. -If you can\u2019t find a drink on the menu, you can kinda ask and they will make almost anything you ask at the bar. -Recommend this resto 100% PS: if you need something you have to ask or else it won\u2019t be provided !

      "I purchased my wedding suit from King & Bay with help from Michael. It was easily the best experience I've ever had purchasing a piece of clothing. I think even my Bride was jealous of the overall experience! The care that Michael took to make sure my garment was perfect for me, suited all my needs and fit absolutely perfectly was amazing. He took everything into consideration from the themes and colours of our wedding, to the venue and our bridal party. Anything I needed help or opinions on Michael was right there to help in any way he could. I would recommend King & Bay to anyone who is looking for custom clothing. 10/10.",
      "Michael was absolutely wonderful to work with. This was our first time doing custom suits and they are worth every penny. This was for our wedding and we weren't sure what direction we wanted to go and Michael guided us through the process. He was meticulous, kind, and very accommodating. Thank you to Michael and the King & Bay team!",
      "As someone who has been buying suits off the rack, and has used custom suit companies such as \"Suitsupply\" in the past, King & Bay is a whole other level of the suit buying experience.  I had the opportunity to work with Michael on the creation of my suit. He was extremely professional and took the time to understand my needs and tastes as I was tired of looking \"boxy\" in every suit I wear. The entire process was an enjoyable experience! I was able to pick out patterns/materials/fabrics that I liked and with Michael's high attention to detail and recommendations I was able to create a suit that not only looks great but fits me perfectly. I will definitely be returning to King & Bay for my next suit purchase! 10/10!",
      "Michael at King & Bay set me up with my suit for the wedding day. By far the best and most personalized suit buying experience of my life! Within 2 consultations, Michael was able to put together the perfect garment for me - hopsack material (light and breathable weavable material perfect for a summer wedding) and guided me into choosing taupe because of how it would pop at the winery I was married at.  The suit was created and tailored by the date that Michael promised and it needed no alterations or additional changes - the first fitting of the suit was the final fitting!  My bride came with me to the 2nd consultation and was very jealous of the experience I had and how intimate & personalized it was. Thank you for making the perfect garment for my wedding Michael. Cannot wait to get my next blazer from King & Bay!",
      "King & Bay will provide you with the ultimate, lavish suit-shopping experience unlike any other. Michael, who is extremely well-versed in men\u2019s fashion, meticulously curated my morning and evening looks for my wedding that perfectly matched my style and personality. After a couple of consultations with Michael, he got to know the kind of person that I am and he recommended the right fabrics, the right colours, and the right patterns. Ultimately the finished product was flawlessly tailored to my exact proportions while still being comfortable. I have never owned suits of this calibre before. But aside from the high quality of the product itself, Michael was a consummate professional and the experience that he created at King & Bay is one that I wish to recommend to any and all men seeking the best suit to compliment their fianc\u00e9es elegance. You will not be disappointed."

      "Delicious food,  great beer, not super loud with music. The crowd is a bit older than I expected like 40s or 50s. Our service was great!  Parked in the TD center building for $10 so not bad.  There were also a few daily specials so you don't have to break the bank to go there.  Enjoyed it thoroughly- will be going again.",
      "Saw all the reviews and decided to visit this place during my stay in Toronto . We were 4 of us and there was a 45 minutes of wait . We got the table eventually and ordered our drinks and food . One of the drink had an insect in it so we had to return it . Then later when the food arrived and one of the meal was not what we ordered so I waited for my food while everyone else ate . Now for an establishment like this one I would have expected some sort of service recovery but literally nothing was done from their end.  Not a single server checked on us during this time to see if the drinks and food was okay specially when they messed up twice . I\u2019m still giving them a good rating because the food and drinks were decent and the restaurant itself has a good ambiance. But service could have been better .",
      "great place! we went on a Sunday during happy hour and despite the crowded place, the service was excellent! Our server (John Henry) was very vigilent and quick. They were amazing. The food was delicious too. We ordered the burger and street chicken tacos. I highly recommend! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
      "Came here for a work lunch and enjoyed a good meal and fast service. I enjoyed the pok\u00e9 bowl as it was balanced, fresh and filling. Vibrant location, good ambience and efficient service to get in and out during the lunch hour, without feeling rushed. Quite pricey for what you get but that is to be expected in the financial district, catering to the office crowd. On separate occasions I've enjoyed happy hour, after work drinks. Overall a reliable option for a work lunch and drinks.",
      "Service needs improvement. We booked for table of 5 and confirmed many times yet our table was registered for 4 for some reason. Had to keep asking the server to add one more place. Guests came at different times and server wanted to wait until everyone came before we ordered our drinks. I wanted my drink immediately but had to wait.. same with my friend who repeatedly asked for more drinks throughout the night and server kept forgetting so that was very disappointing. The food took forever to come. The manager finally came to our table to explain that they overcooked the steak so they\u2019re redoing it and we had to wait longer before they could serve the entire table. Everyone was very hangry at that point after waiting over an hour for food. They could\u2019ve offered us a snack while they asked us to wait even longer but they didn\u2019t. Server rarely checked up on us too. We ended up paying through the app ourselves and we left. The server caught us looking for the washroom and finally asked if we paid. Needlessly to say - we did his job for him and suffered through the night from his and his colleagues\u2019 poor service. Food tasted mediocre. Nothing special and nothing terrible. Atmosphere was loud. Loud music and not many patrons. Surprised service was still so bad considering it wasn\u2019t busy at all. Won\u2019t be back unless I have to."

      "As a concert-goer, the legendary Horseshoe Tavern has been a significant part of Canadian musical lore. You have to go to one of the famous venues with the checkerboard floors!  Opened in 1947, it has gone through various changes and had tons of influential acts played here. Lots of bands started here first and became pretty big like The Tragically Hip, Our Lady Peace and Blue Rodeo. This venue has been captured in a few songs (like Bobcaygeon - The Tragically Hip) and books as well.  It is a very intimate venue with the front bar open 7 days a week and live music and events in the back bar. You do have to walk through the front of the Tavern and pay the entrance fee/concert price to get to the back and watch the band. There is a little bit of seating and standing room in the front that houses a capacity of 400 people. Do expect blocked views if you're seated. However, you can still hear the band up at the front of the bar. Lots of great concert vibes!",
      "Went here for a concert for the first time last night. It is a cool place with an interesting and historic atmosphere. But as a concert venue I didn\u2019t like it at all. There is limited seating towards the back with narrow tables for drinks etc and then a dance floor type area between that and the stage. Lazy people like me want to sit and enjoy some good music. But the ambitious people want to stand in front of the stage which almost totally blocks the view of those seated.",
      "THE place to be if you want to have an intimate experience with  live music at a small venue.  They have a bunch of sitting area with tables right behind a standing area in front of the stage.

      "Margaritas and empanadas were good, and the lady bringing the food was super nice (that's why I'm giving 2 stars and not 1). Guy behind the bar (we sat at the back patio) really had an attitude, as if he was doing me a favour and really didn't want to deal with me, making rude comments with sarcasm every time I went to the bar to order.

      "My sister and I hosted a farewell party here last weekend on Dec 3. This was an important event to us as my sister is moving away overseas at the end of the year. Deciding on this bar was truly the worst decision, and I\u2019d recommend that anyone contemplating going to this bar to strongly reconsider. There were a multitude of issues:  1. The music level in the adjacent room was extremely loud, yet we were asked to keep our music level down. This makes absolutely no sense and when I asked very directly about this, the female bartender was extremely rude and didn\u2019t provide an adequate response or rationale for the discrepancy I pointed out. I asked to clarify this with the bar manager and she wouldn\u2019t call him for me. She asked me to go find him myself? How am I to figure out who the bar manager is? I have never met them before. Unbelievable.  Further, other people asked the same question and she was just as rude when communicating with them. She literally just said \u201cyup\u201d to one person who asked her \u201cwhy is that the other/next door room can have the music louder?\u201d Very poor etiquette/service standards for an establishment that is offering a social setting/event services to abide by. Take your guests more seriously and be interested in how to make their experiences in your bar the best they can be.  2. We requested a specific amount of guacamole and chips with a coordinator (Sandy) by way of email. My sister sent an email directly to him outlining this. However, when we got to the bar and let the bartender know, she was again dismissive and said that your bar only had 4 guacamole/chips left. Totally dismissive of the fact that we had placed the order in advance. Poor communication and coordination.  3. We requested a knife to cut a cake that I had brought to celebrate the promotion/farewell, and were told that the bar had no knives. A bar with no knives to provide upon request to its guests who have paid a decent amount to host an event there? This is bizarre and again in line with the inadequate and rude service I explained above. Take your role and service a bit more seriously and genuinely be interested in your guests\u2019 experiences! We were forced to cut the cake with a plastic butter knife that we thankfully had brought with us.  Completely abhorrent and inadequate bar standards. Truly put a bad taste in our mouths. No proper response from the bar on this matter, and since the date of the party, have heard from many of our friends about the rude service they received.",
      "I hosted a farewell party in their private room just this past weekend. There were a number of issues and I\u2019d really advise against booking any sort of event here.  Firstly, their bartenders and staff were extremely unprofessional and rude. Staff were immediately rude upon our arrival for no apparent reason. Party had not even started, yet we were treated like they could not be bothered with any of our minor questions.  Further, they couldn\u2019t even accommodate our simple request for 6 guacamole and chips which I had sent over in advance and was assured that the order would be communicated/submitted. We also asked to use a knife to cut a cake (also requested in advance) but we were literally told that this bar had no knives to spare?!  Ridiculous. We had to look for a knife and thankfully found a plastic butter knife.  All of that to say, this is probably the worst and least accommodating place to host an event. DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE.",
      "Our group had an amazing night! Great vibes in the bar. Someone in our group left an item behind and the owner was extremely helpful in getting it returned. Highly recommend for a fun night out!"

This would have been a 3.5 star, but I was billed for an Espresso I ordered and never received because their machine was broken, yet it never came off the bill. I did not notice until returning home and reviewing the receipt.  Not a big deal, but still...",
      "Girls night out was a success at Lula lounge. The atmosphere and staff was welcoming. We went here for dinner and dancing, we made reservations a week earlier. Food was delicious and our waiter Dave was amazing and recommended his favourite dishes. Live Band and DJ were awesome. The place was packed but enough space to move and dance. (Nice Cooling Dance floor if you get super heated from dancing) Shout out to the security crew, they have a great team who operates the front. We will be back thank you for the great service and good music!",

The live music is very good and the dance classes too. Nice ambiance but the food was disappointing. I only recommend it for dancing and drinking industrial beer.  The servers were very friendly and the service was very good.",
      "Had a great dinner and dancing experience. With the new food vendor at the restaurant, the food was exceptional!  The house fish with salad was fantastic and the consume was delicious. Live music salsa band playing Friday and Saturday makes for a great dinner, show and dancing experience.  Great for dates too although loud music makes it difficult to talk much.",
      "An establishment that can shine with a few improvements.  Gotta provide better service. Staff were not very well trained. Service was slow and frustrating. Asked 3 different waitresses to clear the table. Took 30min to get that done.  Poor selection of wines and corkage was refused even though the gentleman at the front door had told me that they do provide that service.  Food was mediocre, their signature dish which was the short ribs came out cold. Best dish was the quac.  Slight improvements here and there can really up this place. Wish I could buy this place and transform it. But, understanding the type of crowd this neighborhood attracts, maybe I was expecting too much.  Best wishes."

      "Finally a place with good music, fair prices, nice staff. The drag show was fun. It was a bit crowded, but the place didn\u2019t get boiling hot which is great! You will see all ages which is great. Definitely would be back.",
      "I rarely leave a review but I definitely had to. I had such a great time this past Friday. I booked a booth for 10+ people (highly recommended). All staff went above and beyond. A special shout-out to the bus boys and our server Erika!!!. They all made our experiment a memorable one.  We will definitely be back!",
      "The drag show was good, however the place was to packed and to hot inside. I was hoping to have more salsa and not only reggaeton",
      "I have been attending this gem for the last decade and have always seen familiar faces and always felt welcomed. This place is filled with great staff including Melanie and Paolo. Both of these staff members make this place what it is in customer service and are the reason why I continue to come and always invite my friends and family. Jezabel is an incredible host and a great MC. She truly is a queen that deserves the crown year round. DJ Flames kills it every set and makes this place pop. I'm saddened to here that Paolo isn't there and I'm hoping that this is temporary as I would like to see him there behind the bar with a smile that can light up the whole room and the tentative and great customer service that he brings to the establishment. Everyone please check this gem out and ask for Melanie and Paolo.",
      "Ever since coming to Conventos, I never desired to go to any other clubs in Toronto. I feel safe here. It does get very crowded, I recommend come earlier because the lines tend to get very long even by 10:30 p.m, but aside from that they play dance music which I love comparison to other clubs that mainly play trap music. Always good vibes here. Highly recommend it for any occasion!"

      "Great music and atmosphere! Drinks were great, and food was exactly as expected, definitely a step up from pub food. I had the absolute pleasure of seeing the Julia D\u2019ascanio Sextet and they blew me and everyone else in the room away. Such a great spot for live music. Staff was super friendly and charming!",
      "If you ask a stranger, it\u2019s a jazz bar. But ask even a semi-regular, and they\u2019ll tell you the Emmet Ray is so much more than that.  The venue is deliberately designed to feel like a lounge room. The best way to experience it is by relaxing into one of their many comfy chairs with a glass of your favourite drink, ready to see something spectacular. A dedicated local community guarantees this harmonious attitude, making it feel more like a great caf\u00e9 than a stuffy club. They might operate on a first-come, first-serve basis, but even if you\u2019re standing in the wings, you\u2019ll be able to hear and see everything.  It was my first time to visit and I came across this hidden gem while searching for a live jazz venue, my call was answered by Tom who\u2019s knowledgeable and has a welcoming voice that calls you in, he was the one who also met us at the door when we arrived, the reservation is made through an email sent to Andrew who was not available during our visit but he responded immediately to my reservation request email with detailed explanations on everything we need.  We were served by Jane and Mike, both are a true reflection of high ethics and understand the art of customer service, they both checked on us several times and did everything they can to make sure we are having a wonderful experience.  The live band is a bomb, the music they composed and the way they play their instruments must be seen as no words will describe it fairly.  We ordered their signature salad, tomato soup and their Emmet Burger with fries, a unique flavours that no way I can express in writing.  They charge $10 per person to support the local band which I personally find reasonable and fair however I suggest they waive it in the future for kids.  Their washroom is located in the basement and it was super clean and tidy.  Overall, this is a place that must be seen and visited and it is an icon here not only in Toronto or Ontario but in Canada.  Thanks Emmet Ray team, keep the hard work going on.",
      "My second or third time out. Very cozy. Food is outstanding. Great drink choices, including quite the selection of whiskey. All staff, from everyone in the kitchen to wait and bar staff, are super nice and go out of their way to take care of you. This venue is an hour away for me, by transit, but we'll worth it.",
      "In my opinion this is a hidden gem in the neighborhood, though perhaps a well-known one to the locals. Good vibes, relaxed atmosphere. The food was surprisingly good and a great array of whiskeys and beer. Jen and Andrew saw to everyone's needs, were really attentive, and both seem to also be having a good time.",
      "Food was average. But the service and jazz was great. Our server, a Scottish lad made the evening a ton of fun. He Recommended many great whiskey and scotch options that we loved. Whiskey menu was impressive. Prices fair. Will return."

      "Going to see Memphis May Fire in July was my first time visiting the Velvet Underground and I have nothing negative to say. I felt safe entering as they did appropriate security checks. The bar was clean and had a nice layout for a concert venue. The large basement was a nice place to be able to get a breather, go to the washroom and then get back to the show. There is a parking lot not far from the bar itself to be able to park for long hours, $19 covered our parking for the entire day into the evening right off Queen. As visitors from out if town, we liked the location as we were able to walk about and do shopping, grab dinner and still walk over and get in line for the venue. All the employees were really friendly. I guess the only downfall was the price of drinks at the bar, including water bottles at $4.00 a bottle. But I get it, it's a venue, you got bands playing, people are gonna pay, make your money! Lol. I would most definitely return for another venue in the future if a band I like goes there. As long as it's worth the 8 hour drive for me!! Memphis May fire, rain city drive and from ashes to new was absolutely worth it \ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\udc4d",
      "Friendly staff, great venue for small intimate concerts. The drinks prices are understandably a little high, but more reasonable compared to other venues I've gone to. Saw Joey Pecoraro here tonight in concert and I had a wonderful time. Would definitely come here again for another concert.  It's pretty easy to find and parking in the area was conveniently located too.",
      "Attended a concert here. Lining up experience could have been better managed / signed but the venue was nice. Sound was amazing and security was helpful. Concert lighting was incredible and so were effects. A cozy venue that had the potential for a fantastic vibe when the music is right.",
      "My wife and I saw Wilderado play at The Velvet Underground and it was a great experience!  Once you get through the front doors, you are greeted with a dark and exciting music venue.  We made our way to the front, with a drink, and soaked up some wonderful (and loud) live music from a band we really enjoy.  It felt very personal and intimate, and the crowd was equally enjoying the experience with us.  Thank you!",
      "doesn't look like much from the outside but this is actually a great venue. The staff were attentive and friendly. The sound is great, and the sitelines were wide open. I should mention, I took my daughter to an all ages show, she had the time of her life!"

      "Terrible and unsafe.  Went for New Years Eve, which was supposed to be a ticketed event. Purchased 6 tickets on club crawlers before and got to the club around 11. Line was on wrongside and wasted 20 minutes after they made everyone shift to the other side. Bought tickets thinking that it would be better than a place which was open access and could get crowded. But in line they were letting mostly everyone in (with and without tickets) and the place was filled to the point that you couldn't move freely upstairs. People were packed so tightly that it was definitely a fire/stampede risk environment and certain men took advantage of the zero personal space situation (grabbing and touching my female friends and I inappropriately). Coat check was full so we had to carry our jackets and we wasted time after midnight waiting for drinks downstairs that we never got because they ran out of glasses. Bought two shots of rum at the other bar upstairs for $15 and left asap when it reached the most crowded that you couldn't even dance or breathe.  Overall, it was a horrible first experience at bar 244 and hated the hour we spent there. They were still letting people in as we left. Extremely unsafe environment and do not recommend women to go here, especially for NYE.",
      "It used to be $3 all night, every night for bar rail, which is reasonable (cause honestly, bar rail is bottom of the barrel). Went tonight and Bud Light was $9.25, like.. are you serious? lol. Also, the downstairs club (one of the best parts) doesn't even open anymore??? The best club to go to years ago, and now they've sold out for expensive drinks, and shoving people in the top, and small, space. Lame. Won't go back.  Edit: I will say, 244 used to be my regular place, I loved it. Sure, no cover but if you made a guestlist and showed up before 11pm, you wouldn't have to pay cover anyway. I would have happily paid ten bucks for things to be at least a little similar to how it used to be, what made the place so great. Bartenders told us ALL beer was the same price, which contradicts what is said below.",
      "drinks not even that cheap. worst dj ever - playing constant jamaican songs. overselling tickets and creating a dangerous environment. one loud muffled speaker upstairs and thats it.. really need to renovate the place.",
      "This is a local watering hole with a dance club downstairs. Upstairs there is no cover with music. Good service at the bar.",
      "Nice place -opens after 9 and crowd comes in after 11 -experienced both the non crowded and crowded moments -fun all through! No food -just a bar and dance joint though most nights the underground part is closed ..great bar tenders-parth served us well and the ladies were all smiles too all night despite the crowd"

      "Nice atmosphere. Artists bring the crowd. However low A/C and ine bartender thought they were slick and didn't give me my change. Common ethics to always return that. This is the real reason why I made this review. Sorry lady, you shouldn't have thought I was intoxicated.",
      "Great music nice outdoor patio even on a chilly night. Loved the intimate setting inside. Staff inside not friendly no smiles from anyone. Bouncers we\u2019re nice outside. May try it again.",
      "We came here for a party with friends and it was great! Music was awesome while the place wasn\u2019t packed at all. Then we tried to book a table on our own and didn\u2019t get a response for a week! Their Instagram says \u201cdm to reserve a table\u201d. I dm\u2019ed and got a quick response that someone will reach out via email. Nothing. I followed up and got the same response. Still nothing. Then I sent an email to them instead of waiting for them to reach out to me. A few days later, the night before the party (!), I finally receive a templated email which I had to wait for a week?!! At that point, we already had other plans. It was a very unprofessional treatment from the Booking Manager. If the business says \u201cdt to book a table\u201d then be respectful to actually timely book your customers and not make them wait for a week. As much as I liked my first visit and wanted to introduce more friends to Parlour270, this unprofessional experience just ruined it all.",
      "I visited this business with my wife for a drink for our anniversary.  I accidentally hit with my shoulder another guest while dancing and apologized for it. As a surprise he brought the bouncer and asked him to kick me out. The guest started grabbing me  from my hands basically wanted to fight  with me  while the bouncer being present and not doing anything I was forced  to leave so I didn't make a scene in front of my wife.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL",
      "I went to this place only once. The interior design is very good and stunning. They have two big hall and patio as well. Their music is not the best and it wasn\u2019t my taste and I was wondering with playing good songs this place can be amazing for Friday/Saturday night. We got bottle service and it was pretty pricy. I think this place is good for having parties and they do that too, because when we were there it was a group of people getting ready for birthday party."

The patio itself is accessible and there are some umbrellas to protect in case of rain.",

Food is delicious and well presented and prices are in line with what you'd expect with a place like this.  Service for me was exceptionally slow (over an hour for main course to arrive and even slower to get our finished plates picked up). That being said, without even bringing this up to the staff, they apologized and gave us free dessert which was really nice, especially since it was unprompted. I imagine my experience is very rare and the staff's response to it is definitely a positive lasting impression."

      "3.75*  Chill club with friendly, young patrons.  The door guy, Phil, stood out as an employee in a good way and was understanding and easy going. The promoters were also nice and relaxed\u2026 to the point where you can\u2019t even tell they are promoters and trying to sell and push products. I believe one of them was Michael.  The bottle girls are quite rude\u2014 if I had a dollar for every time I was pushed, I\u2019d be able to afford a booth. Maybe if you\u2019re a rich guy who tips well, you\u2019ll get good service \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.  Pretty good music and functional floor layout. Would recommend!",

It\u2019s just booths next to small paths, so later in the evening it\u2019s just jam packed with people shoulder-to-shoulder trying to get from the washroom to the dance floor. That being said, the dance floor is extremely small, with a booth pretty much taking up most of the space. At around 12:30am the bouncers wouldn\u2019t let anyone outside to smoke\u2026 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a usual thing, but at that point we just left.",
      "Worst experience with the bouncers. They were very rude the second they didn\u2019t see a Canadian ID. I have been accepted to every LCBO, dispensary, and multiple clubs around the same area. I did not show a fake ID, but the bouncers did not even bother to read it as they immediately saw it had another language. I immediately provided a scan of my passport, along with a VALID ID. I asked why my ID wasn\u2019t valid, thinking it couldn\u2019t have been because it\u2019s international, due to this club being popular in one of the most cultural and diverse cities. In no description for the event did it say it was needed to bring 2 pieces of ID, and when I asked why it wasn\u2019t on the event description, given Halloween is a very popular event attracting many international people, the bouncer said  \u201cWell it\u2019s not legal, so we don\u2019t have to, sweetie\u201d. When I spoke to the person in charge, he asked me \u201cHow are we supposed to know this is valid?\u201d And said that putting this information was \u201cNot required by the law\u201d Even though my ID, both valid and not expired, has an official government stamp. On top of this, I paid a fee, for an event that did not even bother to have full detail. I\u2019m upset, and would preferably like a compensation or just a suggestion that, if you\u2019re going to be located within a diverse and multicultural city, start implementing acceptance to other IDs, train your bouncers  to be kinder, and at least take the time to put all information for international people on your event information."

      "Went for a work function to a private event last week. The entire staff was super attentive, but the girl with the pink her was a total rockstar. Great attitude and always willing to help out. Food was amazing too, so we\u2019re the cocktails \ud83c\udf79. Will be back",
      "Probably had more fun in the GTA 5 nightclubs.  Bouncers are the dismissive, arrogant types. They simply suck, other reviews corroborate this.  Music is god awful. Most uninspired club music I ever heard. Awful music made it hard to dance, and few people were dancing even when we left after 3am on a Saturday night.  Bartenders were nice, which gets it 2 stars, though drinks are somewhat pricy and their card machines are annoyingly dated.  The average age of the people there is roughly late 20s, early 30s. I wouldn't go if you're under 25; vibes felt off.  I'm sure this place is more fun for the older crowd, but there are definitely better clubs to go to.",
      "Low-key dance venue, gets alive at midnight, nice crowd, good service. $20-mixdrinks only, no classic cocktails. Works for an afterparty"

      "Dylan! You are an amazing chef. Loved all the food I ordered today. Definitely will come back again. The bartenders are knowledgeable and make the whole experience of visiting Reverie that much more exciting.",
      "This place does not take cash and tells you so after they mix the drinks. Hey, but they do take cash tips! They have two zombie hostesses to greet you when you arrive...not sure if they had a pulse. Need a new DJ. I won't be returning...totally weird vibe. I guess they don't check IDs either cause half the place needed their diapers changed.",
      "From the delicious wine, to the eclectic and thoughtfully presented dishes, my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Reverie! We couldn't decide what to order and opted to go for the tasting menu. Each dish was distinct; the chef incorporated Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and American flavors which did not disappoint. The service was relaxed and friendly. I will return here again (if not just for their amazing brussels sprouts and smoked beef tartar)! Thanks for a lovely and unique dining experience.",
      "What a great find. We we're on a wait list for a nearby restaurant who suggested we go to another place for cocktails. Fortunately for us it had not opened yet. We saw this interesting place next door and we're welcomed in. Very ecletic decor, great background tunes, wonderful friendly service. Fantastic cocktails. We e liked it so much that after our meal at the other restaurant we came back for their deserts and of course more cocktails. Will be back to same their meal menu",
      "Girls night out and of course we wanted to be somewhere pretty and unique.  Reverie at the Park was suggested. The place was beautifully decorated.  Words fail me as I don't quite know where to begin to  describe this restaurant.  You just gotta go and check this place out yourself. As far as the food is concerned, the dishes are tapas sizes to be shared amongst friends.  Here's what I enjoyed: Boneless chicken with pepper jelly.  Omg ... so tender, juicy and flavorful.  The pepper jelly was the perfect pairing to the chicken. Sansho broccolini.  This is the surprise of the night.  I am not a fan of broccolini, but this dish was bold in its taste.  I loved it very much. Smoked beef tartare.  The dish that brought us to this restaurant in the first place.  It came to us covered in smoke.  Great for boomerang!!! Grilled octopus.  A very nice tender dish that's beautifully presented with potato roses.  Very elegant. Miso cod.  Nice gentle tasting fish.  Yum. The service was on point.  You can request for drinks to be made to your liking.  The  server was happy to give suggestions. Great night out.  Highly recommended."

      "When it was open it was a very decent place to go have a drink and a good time. Right now it is temporarily closed for renovations but will be open very shortly in the coming months possibly by Late July or early August 2022",
      "Horrible place, overpriced, bouncers at the front door are extremely rude and are power tripping, the only good thing about this place is that it is CLOSED NOW\u2026\u2026..if I could give no stars I would do I had to give one star and the one star would be for the location that\u2019s it",
      "I used to frequent this place back in the day. The music was always good, it was just busy enough to be a fun night out. The staff has always been nice and, to tell you the truth, the bartenders sometimes overpoured the drinks (can\u2019t complain, right?)  Recently, this place has turned into a bit of a dump, likely because of the sketchy crowds that have started to show up. The pat down outside is more aggressive than a strip search at the airport. The woman even checked inside my socks.",
      "This place is good for the size! It\u2019s a small dance club in Toronto, great staff and good drinks! About the few negative things I\u2019ll have to say are, the DJ that was in the night we went needed a break and what looked like the owner came on to DJ and it was horrible! He should stick to managing the club and not DJing. The other issue is the super low level lighting everywhere. Also the \u201cmust\u201d check you coats. You pay $20 per person to get in and you must check you coat and pay another $5 per coat to have them check in. A bit overboard!",
      "Not sure why everyone is negative about this place... I think its by far the best bar to hit up on college street! Bartenders and staff seemed fine to me, I had a booth and service was great! I love the music and the way the bar is set up. Dance floor is the perfect size, booths are not so close together which made it even a better experience! I definitely will be coming back!"

      "On top of the considerable entry fee the club had a brilliant policy of no card payments under $50. Don't worry though, there is an ATM! You'll just have to wait 10 minutes in a queue. The drinks were nothing to write home about. Prepare to pay $5 for having your coat hanged too.  With regard to the dance floor, the club is just too crowded. The music is alright but generally the same thing; your typical club disco. What doesn't help are the pointless sofas and chairs placed in the middle of the room, as if they intentionally tried to make less space.",
      "Cool spot. Came in early on chill Sunday to check it out. Will definitely need to come again at later time. But I enjoyed listening to the music.",
      "Honestly the vibes weren\u2019t here. Great dj. Bottle service outfits are too much and tacky. Easy to get drinks from the bar. Bartenders are on point. Your better off going to ",
      "Drinks are expensive - $8 for a rail shot. If you're female, don't forget to ask for your free champagne bottle on Saturdays if you have to go here! One bartender refused to give us a glass of water, dating he only sells bottles at that time of night, but the bartender on the other side face it to us no problem after going to her. No credit card payments under $50, which is crazy, it's like they don't want people to spend money... Small venue that was only saved at certain parts sure to the fans. Middle is full of booths that take up half the area to dance. Music was ok at the beginning of the night then weird, slow, repetitive, and bad transitions for most of the rest of the night (2/3 of the time). 4 or 5 toilet stalls for females, 2 sinks. $4 coat check and they try to give you only $5 back! Why??? That's just wrong. Won't be going back.",
      "So I was having a rough time as my wife left with the kids, and work was tough. I had been spending each night miserable at home until this past weekend I decided to check out Nest.  That\u2019s when I found the Barcode Saturdays events, and I have to say, WOW!!! Bottle service was incredible, music was great, and the overall environment was just upbeat and made me feel good again! bless this place!!!! Definitely coming back for another round of party."

      "Stunning views, the friendliest staff, great service from Camilla our server. Good food. Three issues: steak well done instead of rare, sent back to be redone, threw the rhythm of group eating off. Second time perfect. Huge error on bill: charged for 3 bottles of champagne instead of 3 glasses. Ahem. Then on entry told their POS not working for credit - debit. Took out cash at ATM in TIFF lobby. Asked at end if working now, it was. Mixed.",
      "We wanted to try a new seafood restaurant, and this came up on open table. The seafood was delicious and very creative. But the dish I came for (lobster) was  already sold out by 8.30pm which seems early for a restaurant that is open late. They gave us a range of free food to try as a makegood which was excellent so silver lining. I'd go back but we went on a quiet night so they closed early and we watched them put tables away around us as we ate. The staff and food were lovely but definitely not a place for \"vibes\"...",
      "Bright and spacious location with a view of the CN tower! Very delicious plates. They stole my heart from the warm yummy bread served with a salted honey butter, to the octopus appetizer warm salad and the branzino fillet main dish. Just wish the server was a bit more knowledgeable in describing the dishes - the menu is not too large, so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard. :) Nevertheless, we will be back to try their famous truffle fries.",
      "Went for December 31st dinner. My partner got the surf and turf which was amazing. Unfortunately my risotto was way undercooked and crunchy. I was disappointed. Please try the grilled octopus. I had one tiny bite and when I looked up, my partner ate everything because it was charred perfectly. It was a nice ambience. It was cloudy that day so couldn't get a clear view of the CN. I would give them another try in the future. Maybe it will be 5 stars then \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0a",

      "Oh man amazing time! We were killing time between R&D for dinner and speakeasy late night and I\u2019m so glad I picked this place to go to!  They take cards not just cash. There\u2019s a minimum spend (food and drink) but you\u2019re not limited on time or billed by time.  The machine was easy to navigate and easy to find songs we wanted.  We got a bottle of grey goose that came with mixers and just made our drinks in the room. Only funky thing is it was little Dixie cups for our drinks haha. No biggie.  Last note: my husband was confused about the random charges (2x $30) and unfortunately I told him too late that gratuity was probably already applied. So in future we won\u2019t be adding a tip ontop a tip. =)  We had a really great night and would come back again as a result.",
      "I was initially a bit thrown off by the reviews but it\u2019s typically people who had a bad experience who are quick to leave a bad review. I actually had a great time here for a birthday celebration on a Friday night. The sound system was nothing to complain about. The mic died once on us, and after that they would come around to check if we needed a new one. \u2028The karaoke interface was 3.4/5. There were plenty of English songs, but unfortunately some songs weren\u2019t able to be added to the queue (but there were still lots to choose from). My group got the hang of the interface and you can always ask them to help if you\u2019re having trouble. The AC was on blast when I first arrived and was much needed as the night went on lol. They don\u2019t allow outside food since they have a kitchen. The french fries, fried squid and chicken karage were tasty. However, they did allow us to bring a cake.  Okay, cons: they only accept cash! This was not mentioned to me when I first called to book the room and it would have been appreciated if they did disclose this info. Luckily, I followed up with questions - so do your due diligence and ask them any questions you have. You can either start paying as you go or one bill at the end. There are major banks in the area should you need it. They had no problem with us leaving to use the local banks as opposed to their ATM (another review here said they didn\u2019t allow them)  I truly hope they can fix their payment process for the sake of their visitors, but overall it was fun and it was nice to not have a time limit. We stayed from 9pm until normal closing, about 2:30am-ish. Happy singing! \ud83d\ude42",
      "Drinks were weak, but over all this is a great place to chill. Friends and I had a blast. They had most of the songs we were looking for in different languages, too! Great service!",
      "I left a gift here. Called immediately and they said it\u2019s gone and blamed the cleaners. They 1000% took the gift and kept it. Service was terrible and it\u2019s $300 for a bottle of booze.  Some terrible folks working here.",
      "The rooms are nicely laid out and presentation is inviting. Their karaoke system is by far the worst I have ever seen. I have been to truck stop bars with better song selection. The interface for song selection is abysmal and so is the sound mixing. Selecting songs is annoying because their interface prioritizes Chinese music over English. Other than that it\u2019s pretty chill."

The rooms were cleaned because I could smell bleach and the mic\u2019s and song choices were good.

      "Horrible experience !!!!!!!!! We went yesterday, 12 people .. when they charge you ,they tell you one price plus \u201ctaxes\u201d they said !!! but  actually they add $20 tip out on top of that and plus the taxes .. SO BE CAREFUL  \u201c !!!! \u2026BECAUSE they  don\u2019t mention anything if you don\u2019t ask\u2026 they don\u2019t explain anything , you ask questions and they look at you like you\u2019re an alien or something .  10 songs are in English the Rest all in Chinese..  we left an hour later and they don\u2019t even look at you !! Lol .. We went to this other place \u2026 ECHO KARAOKE. Much better 100 times organize and all the songs you want , air conditioner , amazing customers service and the drinks are so delicious!!!",
      "I\u2019ve been here 3 times. The first time was fine. The second time, I booked through a promotor and was told we would get 10% off. Then, the bill came and they said if we pay CASH, it\u2019s 10% off. But the cash was never mentioned when booking through the promotor. This wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, but my group was very unhappy about it and I agree that this was a miscommunication. But I decided to give them one more chance and booked again. When the bill came, they added an automatic service charge and also did not offer a 10% discount. But they said we had to pay in cash - so we had to go to the ATM to do this. Except oddly, they didn\u2019t offer the discount like last time. When I asked, the guy just said \u201cno discount. Cash only.\u201d And I said \u201cwhy? We paid with card last week.\u201d after I asked why many times, he said the card machines are broken today. Essentially, I feel that the place is very inconsistent and has bad communication. It\u2019s inconvenient to go get cash and to me it felt like they were not very empathetic or understanding of our confusion, which only made us frustrated. Had they said from the start \u201csorry our machines are broken today, so it has to be cash only.\u201d It would have been fine. and maybe throw in a round of pop as a courtesy. then, it would\u2019ve been simply accepted.  Karaoke wise, the place is good. Good rooms, clean bathrooms, lots of song selection. But the customer service from a business standpoint needs improvement.",
      "Just awful.  Came with a group of friends and we were meeting others that were already there. Upon entering my one friend walked towards our friends we were meeting there. The bartender began yelling at him because he hadn't checked his ID yet. However, the bartenders English was not good, so my friend kept walking not realizing he was being spoken to. The bartender was very aggressive and continued to raise his voice until my friend ended up leaving because he was so shook up by the exchange.  We were all so appaled by this exchange that we would have left then and there, however the other members of our group had been there for a little while so we decided to stay to meet the minimum spend.  After ordering a few drinks we tried to pay our individual bills but the bartender then told us they can only do one bill. Ridiculous. He then followed this up by telling us it was CASH ONLY. There were no signs or any indication of this before we had ordered drinks.  Oh and they charged my friend $7 for a can of iced tea.  It was absolutely appalling service and rules this place had.  The machine was mostly in mandarin so it was very difficult to use even though the language setting was on English. Finally, the actual karaoke machines had a very limited amount of songs. I'm talking classic songs everyone knows and they were nowhere to be found.  Do NOT go here. I can't stress how awful this experience was. Likely just a money laundering set up, because I can't imagine any place like this running profitably and legally.",
      "Friends invited me to come to this place. There is a Green P parking lot around the corner on Dundas (underground) The place has a good variety of finger foods to buy and a decent variety of drinks (alcohol & non alcohol), I was the designated driver so I had a pitcher of hot lemon drink\ud83c\udf4b and it was really good. The finger foods that was ordered was French fries and a great variety of some delicious Chinese dishes. Also very yummy. The karaoke machine has a variety of languages to choose from, pick your songs and sing away.  \ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d We were here from 8:30ish until late into the night. We were in a group of ten people and the price at the end way very reasonable. \ud83d\udc4d Just my opinion on price because of the amount of people, the time, and the food and beverages. The service staff check in from time to time to help clean and serve you. They are also friendly and helpful. \ud83d\ude0a Place is clean but will get a little noticeably dirty because of food, beverages, amount of groups of people coming and going, but this is normal and acceptable, so don't be discouraged. Fyi, make sure to have some sort of picture ID. It is a must and you will be asked by security and staff when you first enter. The experience was great and fun. \ud83d\ude00 You want a fun time with friends or even work colleagues, I think you'll enjoy yourselves here. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d"

They all were super fun, for escape room go with a good crowd and you will have time of your life.  My favourite was the wine cellar, love the storyline and the experience, a must try. I would recommend going 30mins or even an hour early to just chill, play board games and have some drinks before your game. You can also order food, and you can also take the drinks in the room with you.",
      "I've been here on 3 separate times now with friends to try out different Escape Rooms and even did a session of Axe throwing this last time around. Matt was funny, friendly and did an awesome job turning us into axe throwing experts. Fourth room is already booked and I can't wait to be back!",
      "Went there for the power hour classic Axe Throwing experience with 2 of my friends. The trainer there was absolutely helpful with tips and tricks of how to throw and aim for the first time. I thought it was more so a \u201chere\u2019s how you do it\u201d and be left alone the rest of the session but we ended up learning so many team building or competitive games to keep the fun going.  I ordered the Obituaries Delight as a refreshment and BOY OH BOY how I missed good drinks!! It\u2019s great to see friendly staff and a coat rack - two things I appreciate the most. Overall I had a splendid time and can\u2019t wait to head back again. Thanks Escape Manor!"

      "Came here with a group of 12 and had a poor experience at this venue. The user interface for the karaoke machine was confusing and also hard to use as it wasn\u2019t in English, and only some popular songs were available. The biggest concern here, a warning to future goers, is that there is NO air condition. The room would become very hot and the service was bad, to the point where we would have to bring the water pitcher out ourselves to get water for our room. Several times we would step out of the room to cool down and would see the staff just on their phones doing nothing, and not tending to our basic needs (especially if we\u2019re paying $450). As frustration grew, we raised our heat concern to the front desk and the worker chuckled, not addressing our concern professionally. It feels as if this business is capitalizing on the lack of air condition to charge ridiculous premiums for basic beverages. Below is an image showing the prices of two cans of pop for $18. I would recommend any reader of this review to opt for literally any other karaoke bar in Toronto, as the premium price you pay here comes with poor service, unreasonable menu prices, and no air condition. Don\u2019t come here.",
      "The rooms are really nicely decorated and spacious, they were open until 3am. I had a party of 17 people and they tried to make us book a party room for $500, even though online on their website 17 people fit In a large room $350. So we showed them their online price and they ended up giving us a Party room for the price of a Large room, which worked out even better. The drinks were good and the music options were pretty decent, looking up music was a bit tricky, but we figured it out in the end. The A/C was broken when we went so it was really hot and that made it hard to really enjoy, but overall everyone had a good time. There's an ATM there to pay, they only take cash. Not too bad of a karaoke spot. I would go again with friends.",
      "Garbage service and terrible staff members. They treated my brother on our sisters birthday like he's less than a rock. Cause he's so level headed they didn't get a real reaction. I wished it was me. What is it? Why treat people in such a fashion. The man already has one eye and they are throwing cards at people. \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c",
      "It was a nice place for karaoke but the staff members where very rude and not professional. One they seen me trying to talk to them but they continued to talk among themselves. While I was standing there they continued to make jokes and look in my direction to force me to believe they were talking about me. On top of all if it, I'm walking out the place, one guy threw a card at me as I was leaving. The other staff members laughed at it and didn't apologize. I don't want to pull a race card but I don't understand the level of treatment. I felt unwanted and provoked.",
      "Cash only. Very old facilities. Machines have outdated songs and apparently the quality of the rooms vary within the same venue. Convenient location though for downtown dwellers. Of course it's cheaper if you go as a big group. Not sure if I'd personally wanna go back."

      "The prix fixe menu on discount day was worth the money. I would not say so as much on a full price day.  If you are looking specifically for a Latin club with dinner, it is a good choice and the event manager seems really nice.  If you are looking for a Latin club primarily, there are better options.  This would have been a 3.5 star, but I was billed for an Espresso I ordered and never received because their machine was broken, yet it never came off the bill. I did not notice until returning home and reviewing the receipt.  Not a big deal, but still...",
      "Girls night out was a success at Lula lounge. The atmosphere and staff was welcoming. We went here for dinner and dancing, we made reservations a week earlier. Food was delicious and our waiter Dave was amazing and recommended his favourite dishes. Live Band and DJ were awesome. The place was packed but enough space to move and dance. (Nice Cooling Dance floor if you get super heated from dancing) Shout out to the security crew, they have a great team who operates the front. We will be back thank you for the great service and good music!",
      "I paid 100 cad for a Mexican dinner, but it had only the name. My friends who were Mexican did not like it either, as it was not the preparation they had told me. The live music is very good and the dance classes too. Nice ambiance but the food was disappointing. I only recommend it for dancing and drinking industrial beer.  The servers were very friendly and the service was very good.",
      "Had a great dinner and dancing experience. With the new food vendor at the restaurant, the food was exceptional!  The house fish with salad was fantastic and the consume was delicious. Live music salsa band playing Friday and Saturday makes for a great dinner, show and dancing experience.  Great for dates too although loud music makes it difficult to talk much.",
      "An establishment that can shine with a few improvements.  Gotta provide better service. Staff were not very well trained. Service was slow and frustrating. Asked 3 different waitresses to clear the table. Took 30min to get that done.  Poor selection of wines and corkage was refused even though the gentleman at the front door had told me that they do provide that service.  Food was mediocre, their signature dish which was the short ribs came out cold. Best dish was the quac.  Slight improvements here and there can really up this place. Wish I could buy this place and transform it. But, understanding the type of crowd this neighborhood attracts, maybe I was expecting too much.  Best wishes."

One of the managers himself (the penguin from 1960\u2019s Batman looking one) stated that rap music is \u201cmonkey\u201d music and doesn\u2019t want it playing at the club.

      "This is one of my favorite place along the Roncesvalles strip. I have been here a few times over the years and have always had a good experience. Now given the name, Sangrias are probably one of the main reasons you would come here and they are fantastic and well priced pitchers. If that is not your jam they are also an excellent cocktail bar. This is a great place on hot sunny day and I would highly recommend it.",
      "The food and the service at sangria is amazing!! Our server Thalia was attentive, friendly, and provided amazing customer service. I appreciated that they care about their customers and wants everyone to have an amazing experience. If you haven't had their sangrias you are missing out. Excellent food as well!! We will be back soon!!",
      "Love this place! We go at least once or twice per week.  Really nice food and great cocktail selection. Love it!  Would love to see a Trivia night or something. Would be great!",
      "My experience here was beautiful, we ordered for red wine sangria and chicken wings and fries the drinks were a 8/10 because there wasn\u2019t enough alcohol more fruit juice, which the fries were 10/10 crunchy and crispy. The wings were a 6/10 there was taste and flavour but not the best I had, fine for the price but also felt a little dry. The ladies running/ managing the place were lovely. Definitely a place for some drinks with friends",
      "Had a great time at this place today. It's a real gem - the food and drink are affordable, and it's a wonderful space to sit and hang out with friends.  I reccomend getting a pitcher of the peach sangria, with red wine and an extra shot of peach schnapps. In a city that regularly charges 40-60 for a pitcher, Sangria lounge offers 20 bucks for a pitcher with a few extra dollars for a shot of additional alcohol. I went with 2 others, and we comfortably had about 2 glasses per pitcher."

We had only been at the front door for 4 minutes when we were finding an uber to leave.  A man, presumably an employee or the owner, was extremely rude to us and basically forced us to leave their roof. His exact words were \"this is a business, you have to move, move!\"  We couldn't find any other shelter from the thunderstorm at the time, so we were forced to walk through it. This was a locally 30 to 50 mm thunderstorm, according to Weather Canada.  My friend was experiencing discomfort as a result of an underlying medical problem. Fortunately, she is feeling better now as I write this comment, thanks to proper treatment.  As a small business owner myself, I appreciate and support local businesses, but I must state that this is not the right way to do business, and it is certainly not the right way to treat people.

      "The establishment opened later than the listed time, and the owner rushed us out when his friend wanted our table, without warning. We had been spending money all night, truly a uniquely disrespectful experience.",
      "Came specifically to try out this shisha place to find out there is no coconut charcoals available??! This is crazy. Also after I sat down at the table, the bartender didn\u2019t bring out the menu, but rather returned back to the bar desk and kept minding his own business, while I was staring at the surroundings. I had to get up and leave at this point as it was too much of a disappointment already. Overall loved the vibe and abundance of cool neon signs, but service is apparently questionable. I would definitely give this place another chance, but due to the fact that they are not using coconut charcoals, I doubt I will come back here.",
      "Such a great vibe , very professional and clean. The hookah was great! Definitely worth going there",
      "Hospitality is crazy. A spot I'm definitely coming back to. Rare to see in Toronto."

      "I have gone to this restaurant when it was Pearl Court and before the restaurant renovation when they used to have this real inexpensive Asian gem feel in the restaurant and served the food on carts. Don't get me wrong, I love the new vibe, but with the price increases on the food ($7 per dim sum item) it is hard to justify 5 stars for the restaurant now. The food is quality and the curry cuttlefrish got later after the reno and I really appreciate that. However, gone are the days of $30 for 2 people early bird dim sum pricing. On the new menu, highly recommend the sizzling platter (beef) - it is delicious!",
      "Excellent quality dim sum. It\u2019s going to be a new go-to spot for me! My favourite was the pan fried shrimp and chive dumplings, pictured below. Bonus \u2018liminal\u2019 atmosphere as you pass through the upstairs bar to the bathroom.",
      "Overall good experience, interesting menu, cozy atmosphere. We ordered the Typhoon Mountain lobster, which turned out to be 2 deep fried lobsters covered in fries with sweet and sour sauce on top. Interesting combo of flavours, and pretty certain these were McCain fries. The bbq pork buns were great, lots of filling and the bread is very soft. And they had great spicy mustard that was amazing with hargow. Would come back and try more items on the menu.",
      "Best dim sum place I\u2019ve ever had!! I dined in for the first time here (usually I order take out) and it was amazing! Ordered way too much food but leftovers are always good \ud83d\ude0d The black pepper short ribs are my fave dish, melt in your mouth delicious! The ingredients are always fresh with chunks of ginger in it. I\u2019d always wanted to try the green beans with minced pork and was not disappointed! Deep fried tentacles are always on my go-to order as well \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffd Service was great and pretty quick too. Pictured: Har Gow, Siu Mai, Deep Fried Octopus Tentacles, Black Pepper Short Ribs, Ginger Chicken & Pineapple.  Just fyi - sometimes takeout orders don\u2019t come with sauces so just make sure you have some at home.  I will be dining in and ordering again for sure :)",
      "I took my grandmother here for dim sum and we enjoyed it! It is one of the only places serving dim sum on this side of town and the food was excellent. It came out quickly and was fresh and hot. The har gow were generously stuffed with shrimp, siu mai were very tasty, and we really liked the shrimp rice noodle rolls. We tried the deep fried shrimp with salad and that was also perfectly crisp and flavourful. They had a lot of other lunch items on the menu and we also ordered the XO noodles, which were also delicious. The char siu baos could had a higher bbq pork to dough ratio, and I wish they offered a few other options like ham sui gok, wu gok, or bbq pork rice noodle rolls.  The ambiance and decor inside is more modern, clean, and well thought out than typical places I've visited.  The total was a bit more expensive than other places we've gone to in Chinatown but we didn't mind since it is the only place in the area, the food was good, and the decor was nicer than usual.  Other reviews and photos mentioned sushi, but that wasn't an option on the menu we were given today - we only saw dim sum or Chinese food as options."

      "I really wanted to enjoy this new place seeing the positive reviews and photos, but the sushi rice was awfully hard for the maki and nigiri when we received our lunch order. The maki had way too much rice when the image reference had shown more of a 1:1 ratio as the traditional maki is done.  The sashimi was thickly cut and seemed fresh, while the oshizushi was flavourful, but after having the tuna maki - and seeing the rice - I couldn't help but think all the toppings were just used to mask the old rice. I don't mind too much rice with my sushi, but it has to be fresh at the very least!  Wasabi was also given in abundance, but based on the different colour on the outside and inside, we knew it wasn't very fresh either... All of these cues just left our stomachs feeling off for the rest of the day.  I would recommend this place for the sashimi and to satisfy an oshizushi craving, but I can't really vouch on anything else.",
      "Found this gem sushi store during lockdown when they were still renovating and only providing takeout. They finally opened up last week! I can in on a Sunday evening and got myself one of their booth seat. The environment is great and the sushi is amazing! Absolutely in love with their torched scallop and salmon \ud83e\udd24. Will definitely keep coming back.",
      "We decided to check out Tenjin Karaoke spontaneously one night while walking home and are extremely happy we found\u00a0this gem of a place. We've returned multiple times ever since and\u00a0have recommended it to many friends for birthday outings or just a night out.\u00a0\u00a0Always a fun atmosphere with reasonably priced drinks and some of the friendliest staff/owner. For nights where you want to go out to something more than a regular bar but not to a club, Tenjin's the perspect spot to visit. We definitely needed a venue like this in the east end.",
      "Outstanding sushi restaurant out in East Chinatown. Love their torched ebi (shrimp) oshizushi, but my FAVOURITE is definitely the torched scallop sushi\u2026 so juicy, so flavourful!!!! Both are part of their torched sushi tray\u2026 worth the try!!!",
      "Idk anything about their sushi, but the Karaoke was sick. They have a deal with wings and beer (3-4 people's worth) that's super fairly priced."

      "I was told that it's been recently renovated. But I'll say that it's still a greatly designed space. The views of the Toronto skyline are amazing. The drinks are mixed well and fit the swanky atmosphere. We didn't come to eat, so I can't speak on the food. Drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but you are in the Park Hyatt, so just be prepared. Our bartenders were nice, and we had a great conversation. Would definitely come back.",
      "Pricey cocktail bar in the Park Hyatt. Out of the three cocktails I tried, I really enjoyed two - I\u2019m not a very sophisticated drinker but those just tasted good to me. Also the presentation was very pretty. The one I ordered for myself, the Age of Mass Culture - it just felt like I was drinking straight alcohol. Which may be what it is, I\u2019m just not experienced enough to know! I think the value is reasonable but each cocktail is around $20, so it can get expensive.  Overall the ambiance is great, on a Thursday night around midnight there were a good number of customers and the patio is available for some pictures of the Toronto skyline. It was a nice experience but probably only for people who appreciate these finer cocktails!",
      "It\u2019s my third time having dinner at writers room. I\u2019ve had great experiences before so this time I brought my friends from New York there. The view was still breathtaking, however, we were really disappointed with everything else. First, the service was extremely slow. We sat there for 1.5 hours without getting our main course so we checked with one of the servers and she told us our dishes will be served shortly. But it took 30 more minutes to come. The bar was half empty at that time so we didn\u2019t know what made it that long. We were very patient at that time until our steak come. The first pictures shows the steak I had in May at writers room. It was very juicy and tender and it came with baked mini potatoes with special sauce. So I ordered it again this time. The steak in other pictures is what we got this time. It looks very sad and dry. Does it look like medium rare? Is that even steak? It tastes like beef jerky. Also, it came with fries instead of the baked potatoes and the plate was smaller. Just\u2026everything about it was not right. Quality was much lower. The drinks were fine but won\u2019t come again. I had really good impressions but it\u2019s all gone now.",
      "Newly renovated rooftop place on top of Hyatt. A little bit on the pricy side. Seafood were surprisingly amazing. Cocktails are pretty decent but the seasonal drink menu was a bit bland I feel. Overall very good experience.",
      "Writers room is a hidden gem in Toronto for sure. Really stunning views with great cocktails and ambience. This place is not cheap at all but I wouldn\u2019t expect different from a sky bar in the Park Hyatt. Highly recommend the \u201cA good day\u201d and \u201cWalking Dream\u201d cocktails. Truly unique.  The food was decent too. The fried chicken and lamb tartare were awesome. I don\u2019t recommend the tater tots.  Giving a 4* instead of 5 just because the food was really pricey for what it was but otherwise everything about this place was awesome!"

      "I recently came to Insomnia for their weekday brunch and it was delicious!  The fruit was really fresh and the French toast+eggs Benedict were both delicious!  I usually come to this spot for late night eats and drinks and I was pleasantly surprised by their brunch aswell!  I will definitely be coming back and I would recommend this spot to a friend!",
      "Amazing food, amazing vibes and amazing staff. Those 1lb mussels are ridiculously good almost criminal and i got a fried chicken burger and loved it. It had a bit of like maple syrup that really made it crazy good but not too much to drown the rest of the taste out. My girl got the chicken linguini and it was amazing. That and a bottle of wine made it a great night I\u2019m definitely adding to my list of go to spots when I\u2019m in the city.",
      "When I checked this place out I really wanted to get some brunch  the food looked so good in the pictures. Unfortunately, I got there right before the start of the dinner menu. They had stopped serving brunch.  The space has a nice ambiance. The timing was such that we were the only people there but it didn't feel strange. You know that feeling when you're the only person at a restaurant and you start to wonder if you made the right decision? If there was a reason no one else is there? Well this wasn't the case. Felt right at home.  The food arrived relatively quick. Everything tasted absolutely incredible. The texture of the food was just right.  You get the feeling that this place has more of a nightclub feel at night. I still want to go back and have brunch here \ud83d\ude42  I definitely recommend In-Somnia!",
      "My friend and I had to wait for good 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. Then good 45 minutes to get our food. Once we finished eating (in 20 minutes), we were asked to leave 15 minutes later because according to them, it had been a while. We would not have been sitting there for that long if the food was given to us sooner than 45 minutes. I will not be returning there again because of their slow service and time management skills. Food on the other hand was not bad. I ordered waffles and egg Benedict.",
      "My date ordered Lorraine Benedict and I got citrus-spiked french toast. We had a wonderful experience! I must say, the setting is breathtaking. They have plants on the walls and fairy lights hanging from the ceiling, which I adore. They have the bathroom downstairs - it was modern and clean, which made me feel extra special.  My french toast was light, fluffy, and incredibly tasty. The presence of a hint of citrus flavour was unexpected, but it worked well. The experience blew me away; it was wonderful!  Our waiter was quite pleasant and helpful. As this is supposedly a popular brunch spot in downtown Toronto, it's quite busy. Otherwise, coming here was a pleasure!!"

      "I brought my wife here for her birthday and we had an amazing time. Thomas took care of us from start to finish and was amazing. The whole experience was fantastic and well executed. The dome/igloo was warm and cozy but not claustrophobic.  We got the package with a couple of appetizers and drinks and then ordered some food from the menu. Everything was delicious and presented nicely. We were also pleasantly surprised with the birthday dessert.  We had a great time here and recommend it to anyone.",
      "We had the outdoor tent experience with a few friends Monday night.  First there were some confusions with our reservation as it was placed as a regular table.  It was originally placed as outdoor tent seating, but we had to change the time and it somehow it reverted to regular indoor seating (which we were just not interested in)  $65 per person will get you 1 drink, 1 appetizer and 1 dessert.   So don't expect to be full when you leave, unless you show up NOT hungry.  You can of course always order from the regular menu and add it in, which we had to do.  Add another drink per person, and you have yourself a bill north of $200 for 2 people, and no dinner was served.  Seating in the tent is casual, not a dinner sit down.   You are in essence \"lounging\" for 1.5hrs while picking at your apps.  The tents are nicely appointed, with enough seating for 6 comfortably.  There are orange blankets for added warmth, and the Halloween/ fall theme is nicely carried out throughout.  It was a nice experience.   Probably wouldn't do it again, but may visit again once they launch a Christmas themed experience.",

Would highly recommend it for an event or a small gathering with friends. It\u2019s never been too busy but a great spot.",
      "One of my favourite places in the city. Attentive, friendly service. Nice romantic vibes. Great food and drink. Cool patio area\u2014 there are heated igloo-type things in the colder months so you can still be outside (however, it is a fixed menu).\u00a0Because it\u2019s on Bloor and Avenue, it\u2019s almost impossible to find parking so I\u2019d suggest you use a ride share service, public transit, or walk."

She took the time to understand what each of us looked for in a cocktail, and what kind of drink-mood we were in.  For myself I went with her suggestions, and she made me several freestyle cocktails that were honestly some of the most memorable drinks I've ever had.  The whole group was very happy with her guidance and enthusiasm. She knocked it out of the park, and we'll definitely be coming back!!  Thanks so much, Gord",

Before writing this review I read few reviews about this bar, and some people wrote that the food was nothing special.  I will allow to disagree with these statements.  D|Bar & Four Seasons chef was able to take ingredients that we see everyday day and turn them into masterpieces. Very delicate flavors & absolutely astonishing presentations.  Great & relaxing atmosphere: I felt extremely good and couldn't stop smiling.  Thank you very much!",
      "FOOD: nothing special but overpriced (I get it because it's in a hotel). But for the price I expected something more flavorful and just better. \u2022 Vietnamese salad: I'd say Vietnamese inspired salad, it's so bland and far from the original dish. \u2022 Oysters: fresh but really small \u2022 Tuna tartar: again, lack of flavor. I thought I had covid when I tried these dishes.  DRINKS: love the drinks I had \u2022 Afternoon tea: one of the most special drink I have ever tried, really creative. Smell and taste absolutely amazing, creamy and earl grey tea infused. \u2022 Collagen cocktail: very refreshing, they tried to make it special by light up a fresh passion fruit decorated on top of the cocktail.  INSIDE: quite crowed and loud after 10 11 ish. The vibe feels up scale but a little too dark.  SERVICE: very professional and fast, they have the service quality of a big hotel. We arrived and immediately got a valet parking",
      "Amazing, personalized service.  We had High Tea ($65 per pax) as well as a burger from the lunch menu, plus a bottle of sparkling wine.  My hubby does not eat veggies and I noted this in the reservation. The restaurant took the effort to personalize his high tea items and replaced those that contained vegetables.  When he ordered an extra burger, the service staff knew immediately about his aversion to greens and asked if he would like them removed from the burger.  The small things that the staff took the effort to remember really made a big difference to the experience.  Food is good. Ambience is great. The defining aspect of the whole experience is the service.  All in all, we paid $300++ for everything. Expected from a luxury hotel.",
      "Beautiful upscale bar for fancy folks looking to have a luxurious night night out. The cocktail prices start at a heinous $20 for maybe 150ml of drink. The drinks were scrumptious\u2014however not for the price tag. The service was wonderful. Would recommend if you\u2019re willing to spend a lot of money on small drinks."

      "An okay cafe, mid sized, good seating selection. A good place if you just need to work or read a book. Chairs a not exactly too comfortable. I dog the art vibe here 8/10.  Place is blasting cold air and not in a \" cold air on a hot day\" kind of way. I had a brownie which was very good but coffee quality 4.6/10 and the baristas aren't too knowledgable on how to make anything. Overall 5.3/10 would not recommend. Find yourself another one around there's a bunch.",
      "What a cool, relaxed, and calm shoppe!  Staff are incredibly friendly and kind. Terrific coffee and muffins, among other goodies and snacks. Love the local artists showcased throughout, and didn't expect such a spacious section downstairs. (Just wish there were allergen-free options...)",
      "I was not super impressed with Slanted Door for breakfast. I hear their coffee is amazing, but the breakfast sandwich I had was not great (I did not understand the inclusion of pickles) and their hot chocolate was not chocolatey enough. The vegetarian options were available, but were not good. The art inside the shop is beautiful and the space is accessible including a washroom for people with physical disabilities.",
      "OK this review is just on their energy balls. They were fantastic. Not too sweet lots of nuts and there was two versions when I was there a peanut butter and a chocolate peanut butter and the chocolate peanut butter was not overly sweet it was very nice. I did get a Americano and it was OK but I went back the next day as I was in the neighbourhood to get more energy balls. The caf\u00e9 itself was full of people doing work at the tables. it\u2019s pretty spacious but busy I would just go back for the energy bars. They have other things as well I think some breakfast sandwiches and croissants but I didn\u2019t try those",
      "Visited Slanted Door last week and it was such a relaxing and soft space to be in to focus and get work done. The baristas are seriously the sweetest people ever and care so much about customer experience. I will definitely return - the annex's true hidden gem!!"

      "Over all a fun experience! Lots of games to chose from, the staff was incredibly friendly. My server in particular gave everyone in my group a good laugh. I want to come back and try the escape rooms.  I found my drink to be \"just okay\". It was the pirate drink and where it had many flavours, it also had none? A very subtle sweetness. Not my thing, but I'm sure a lot of other people would like it.",
      "Came here with my friends for the escape room and it was amazing. The game master also had wonderful energy, and hyped us all up.  They have a lot of board games and cool drinks as well. Looks like this will be our new hangout spot \ud83d\ude06 can\u2019t wait to come back here again",
      "We had our staff Christmas party at Dream Escape. The escape room was so fun. It is challenging but I loved the theme and all the sound effects. Lots of games to choose from and Mario Kart was a hit. Food was awesome. One colleague said they were the best chicken wings he'd ever had. And the drinks were so tasty. Everyone loved the signature cocktail and the mocktails. Oh and Karaoke was a bonus surprise hit! Thank you thank for hosting our group.",
      "I never tried escape games before Dream Escape and my first experience won't be the last! Super cool, incredibly designed, and immersive game. My friends and I had a blast!  It's the type of place you know you will spend quality time. The staff is very friendly, I'll will definitely be returning for the new escape room.",
      "I went with a group of 6 - we escaped from the alien themed escape room, then played games and had drinks. The escape room was a lot of fun - very thoughtfully put together, and challenging enough for the whole team to be involved and work together. There's also a great selection of games and lots of booth seating if you're looking for a place to hang out with a group of friends.  Also, I tried their non-alcoholic ginger beer, which was delicious!"

      "My friends and I had a great time. Room was clean, sound system was good and so many options to chose from. Our room was ready on time and they even had a timer to let us know when our time was coming to an end. I would recommend booking for 3 hours if you are with a group. We went on a Friday and they were quite busy so we were unable to extend our time. Overall great experience",
      "My friends and I had a lovely time here! The location is pretty great and the rooms are nice. Best part was that the rates are so cheap and affordable. Song selection for the most part was pretty good!  Totally recommend :)",
      "The prices are great, wide soju selection, and huge song book to choose from. The staff is very nice and the rooms are very clean. Overall a very good experience I can't wait to go back again.",
      "So this place was very nice, I really liked the bar vibe at the bar. You should know that unlike other karaoke places you cannot bring outside food to the private rooms. Also there isn't service to your private room, you have to go to the bar....which is totally fine. It was very clean...also clean washrooms. Some thing to be aware of that I saw other ppl mention and was a bit unsure. I read reviews where ppl say that it's hard to manage the karaoke book or list as it's in Korean....it's actually not difficult once you actually give it a try. The songbook/tablet is in Korean but has buttons in English....and that's all you really need to know, how to punch in artist, how to punch in a song and how to delete a song. Overall we all had a good time. The only thing that I thought was very weird and silly was that we were there for a birthday and the birthday person left a gift which was 2 chocolate bars and a card in the room. The room was cleared out immediately after the group got out. In under the hour someone went back to say \"hey, did you find a card and two chocolates left behind? They were a gift\"...... The response from the staff was all shoulder shrugged and \"ummm we throw everything out.... But your card is here\" We admit the items should not have left behind but don't u put things aside or were they eaten asap? \ud83e\udd23 Very silly.",
      "Came with a bunch of coworkers for someone's birthday. It was our first time coming to this karaoke bar.  A majority of the songs are in Korean even the set up but they do have large book with songs that you can pick from.  However the English songs only have a small selection so you'll be more likely to find the more popular songs from the 90s/2000s."

They also had us stand in line for over 45min despite all the people leaving the bar/dance floor.

      "Absolutely disgusted and disappointed in this club. Decent cover charge however, 9.50 for a bottle of water is ridiculous. The dancers (if you want to call them that) seemed nice until they wanted to take you into the back room. Not once do they mention how they charge for vip dances. After basically being forced and dragged into the back room, feeling completely violated and having the dancer force himself on me, came back to my seat to be told I owe him $100. He was persistent on waiting right at my side while I paid him. Ladies beware\u2026.they charge $20 a song and do not give you the choice to have them stop or continue dancing. I\u2019ve been going to another club (klub kave) for months now and have never ever felt so violated and upset being there as I did at this place. The dancers didn\u2019t barely do anything and for the most part, I felt like I was at a ballerina recital. I will not be attending this venue ever again. I literally left almost in tears and severe anger. The best part about the venue was Mario, the bartender.",

      "... this brilliant and unique bar embodies the 90's era Toronto Raptors purple and red aesthetic while honoring its own unique spin on bar cuisine. With a mesh of Indian and Canadian dishes, Toronto Style Bar & Grill is a trip.  Rainbow lights. Karaoke on weekends. Pool and darts available.  THE SWEETEST WAITRESS EVER.  ...

Great service from friendly staff. It feels like home, with friendly patrons and inclusive activities.  The drinks and food are well priced, and this place is worth a visit if you enjoy a real bar free of edison bulbs, industrial style stools, neon signs that would say \"Dont let me eat alone\" or something like that. This is an honest and humble bar and you'll feel the warmth immediately!",

      "I'm brand new to the neighbourhood and was in desperate need of a cut (it had been six months since my last cut) so I booked an appointment with Sean.  I told him to have at it and see what he does with it and I have to say he was not only incredibly knowledgeable about his craft, but he was very careful to explain why he was doing specific things.  Well worth the money I spent. Affordable, amazing tunes to listen to (we were singing some Motown together the entire time), and just an overall great vibe in the atmosphere.  For friendly service and a guaranteed great end result, check this place out!!",
      "Awesome vibe, awesome people!  I Was in town for a wedding and the men in the bridal party were booked for cuts, we were INCREDIBLY behind and showed up super late but these amazing people got us in chairs despite that. The conversation was great with my barber (Sean I think) and the cut was fantastic. If I'm ever in Toronto again in need of a snip, these guys are where my money is going!",
      "This is my go to barber in the city. Lots of stylist available and you can't beat the decor.I found this place about two years ago, and haven't gone anywhere else to get a haircut since. You can have drink there while having your hair cut. Trek  has been cutting and styling my  hair and beard  for the past the last 2  years and I don't think I would go anywhere else.The Price is not cheap but  reasonable for all the amazing service that they provided. Highly recommend this shop.",

      "Who knew there was a labyrinth right in the middle of downtown Toronto. While walking the area I noticed a sign directing you to the labyrinth and decided to go check it out. It is a large circle in Trinity Square with a path leading to the centre using paving stones of two tones. It was just an interesting way to spent a few quiet minutes tracing the route to the centre of the labyrinth. The square was also being used by a few homeless with tents set up but although I thought they probably question the logic of wandering a route through the Labyrinth, they just ignored us.",
      "Not much to look at but there is shade and a grassy area to sit and eat lunch. The labyrinth wasn't all too impressive i.m.h.o, just flat concrete and map of the area to walk. Tried to get a better vantage point with the drone but got the dreaded \"too close to an airport\" warning. Nice place to relax for a bit but not much else. Some areas near the church have a few aggressive homeless people there so just be on your toes...",

      "The Toronto Public Labyrinth (formerly the Trinity Square Park Labyrinth) is Toronto's first outdoor labyrinth in a public park. Designed by Stuart and Mary Bartholomaus from Knoxville, Tennessee. The labyrinth was created out of turf grass, temporarily, but is now constructed out of paving stone. The labyrinth is 77 feet in diameter. It is a copy of the 13th century stone labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral in France.  Installation of the\u00a0Toronto\u00a0Public Labyrinth The Labyrinth was installed as a Millennium project in partnership between Parks, Forestry and Recreation and the Toronto Labyrinth Community Network (TLCN). TLCN is a grassroots community organization which fosters the creation of labyrinths as meditation tools in the Greater Toronto Area. In partnership with Toronto Parks and Recreation and the nearby Church of the Holy Trinity, the group guided the creation of the Trinity Square Park Labyrinth as a Millennium Year project.  TLCN, in continued collaboration with Parks and Recreation, will also guide the development of the \"Lasting Labyrinth\", a permanent labyrinth feature of stone and grass, to be installed at Trinity Square Park.",

      "Was really nice, quite warm (it's a green house so makes sense). Didn't cost a thing, was totally FREE! The gardens have three halls. The walking path is not always wide and accessible \u267f, and there is only one bench to sit on (in the farthest garden). The vegetation in the garden is diverse and presented in a nice way. There are also turtles! Really loved it \ud83d\udc95",
      "Wow! Such a beautiful greenhouse! Just as good as others that I have had to pay $15 to enter...this one's free!! It's very big with many different sections that have all sorts of beautiful plants + Koi Fish and turtles!! The main building is super pretty and they're doing renovations right now to make it even better.",
      "I came here on the final day of my plant biology course, and it was an amazing time. There were so many cool looking plants, and flowers, including some that I didn't even think I'd see in Canada (like the papaya or the Dutchman's pipe). This is a great place to go to, to see all kinds of spectacular floral displays you might not be able to see anywhere else - and the best part is that it's free!",
      "The gardens are beautiful and it's plenty warm inside. Is it worth taking a trip specifically for it? You'll be done walking around in 30 minutes at most, especially now after they closed the palm house for renovations. Still, if you happen to be in the area or live in downtown, it's worth making a stop. It's free and the gardener was very friendly to answer inquiries.",
      "no matter what season outside, it's always summer here. I just love this place. so happy to see it reopened after a very long Covid -19 closure. there are some renovations under way now, so part of the greenhouse is not available (sadly including the washrooms). it is free and opened 7 days a week. a few benches inside which is wonderful. it tends to be super busy on the weekends so try to visit during the week if you can. Keep in mind that it is not the most savoury part of the city and you might encounter some interesting characters around the greenhouse, but they usually mind their own business. if you miss connection with fauna, you can connect with turtles, fish and an occasional squirrel. the place is really well maintained, there are always beautiful flowers. Lovely cacti in the north part."

Saw some women leading some children through stretching and yoga moves all while trying to keep out of the rain. Bad weather can't stop all these people from getting fresh air and exercise. Just up the street the is also a very lively skate park filled with kids having fun. There is also a workout area and a jungle gym set up too. Big props to the city of Toronto for having this place, more provinces need to adopt this type of thinking. We do have skate/bike parks in Victoria B.C but this place is on another level with murals and the overpass above makes it very unique..",

There are beach chairs to sit on under iconic pink beach umbrellas. The sand isn\u2019t the best as people do throw out trash and cigarette butts, but it\u2019s nice enough to be able to take your shoes off and feel the warm sand between your toes.

The biggest downside to this park is there isnt much to do. There is not a lot of green space to play on and there are a few benches, but I found they were usually taken. Its definitely worth a visit, but I would plan to walk end to end in 15 minutes and then head towards the beach or the harbor",

      "Was a nice place to go for a walk especially in the winter. The sunset was a bright red, the winter sun gleamed in the horizon. The kids had a lot of fun breaking ice pieces off the ground and throwing it onto the lake. The breeze was immense, it was a peaceful escape in the city. Would recommend to anyone looking for a winter stroll in the city. Only criticism is the ugly slush and dirty snow that is not cleaned."

Gravel and lack of water what a waste of money no brainer",

      "I find this a pathetic excuse of a park. The trees and benches are nice, but the fact that fine gravel was used instead of something green on the bottom surface just ruins it. Maybe it's just disappointing relative to Corktown Common."

      "2022 July 3\u2605 A good amount of green space, a small play area with a slide, swings and a see saw. A splash pad nearby. Most people come here to just relax, picnic and really enjoy the weather. The trails are nice and are part of a larger path.  Pros: public washrooms Limited Paid parking on nearby side streets.",
      "Ummm. There\u2019s something about this park I can\u2019t quite point, maybe it\u2019s the layout or the architecture, you walk in the ways and end up in the same place that\u2019s common to all. 4 stars because I saw a frog, a baby bunny and some water lilies in the swamp pond. Otherwise I\u2019d give it a 3 maybe? I don\u2019t know if it were just my expectations. I do like the area and the place it\u2019s located in. Other parks are more open and vast spaces without barriers, this one has multiple small hangout places with barriers.",
      "The pros to this park is that it has lots of green space to have a picnic or to relax. There are benches and picnic tables available. There is a nice small swirl of a trail as well. The splash pad is decent but what sells is the view. You can see the CN tower and the city from the splash pad. My 3 year old had an absolutely amazing time! The park is pretty nice too with swings, slides and see-saws. It is close to distillery district by walk.  The cons is definitely the parking. The outdoor street parking AND indoor parking fill up so fast!! We spent over 15-20 minutes looking for parking. I\u2019m not a fan of the metal slides in the playground. We went on a hot July afternoon and I had to say no to my son who wanted to go on the slide so badly.",
      "The landscape design is thoughtful and calming. There\u2019s something for everyone: kids playground, dog owners, solo walkers, couples, and groups. The mini park connects to the DVP trial and lakeshore trail east and west making it easy for bikers and runners. I only wish it were 10 times bigger. Public washrooms available.",
      "Wow! Didn't expected this thoughtfully designed green space and recreational area. It seems like an ideal environment for local residents to relax and play here. With all the condos in the new Canary District, it probably is still not enough green space for the growing population... Yesterday, there were so many people in the park area - all the picnic tables were occupied. But for what it's worth, it is still a gem."

A green oasis right in the middle of the financial district.  It has nooks and crannies throughout, so be careful when you visit. I found drug needles and discarded clothing and garbage on the upper levels. The park isn't well maintained, which is such a shame. I didn't feel comfortable visiting this park - not even on an early Sunday morning - because of people loitering there.",

It also has a water treatment facility at the pavilion as well and releases it from the three art sculptures located on the north side of the park. Pretty iconic structures!

The sculptures entitled \"Light Showers\" are a sight to see at night as they light up at night and motion sensors trigger light patterns!",

      "Iconic landscape and great must-visit tourist spot to get photos of Toronto. It's also a good meeting spot with friends and family. There's always something interesting and events hosted here at Nathan Phillips Square.  Located at Nathan Phillips Square (in front of City Hall), this versatile large water fountain remains as a fountain/pond during Spring, Summer and Fall. While in Winter, the fountain transforms into an outdoor Ice Rink for the public to enjoy. There are skates rentals on site but be prepared to line up and bring ID. This captivating setting is enjoyed all year long for people of all ages. Many seasonal activities and events are planned around this fountain and at Nathan Phillips Square so be sure to check the Festivals & Events Page on the City of Toronto's website.  Also to note, from the southwest corner of the fountain, you can take a photo of the iconic Toronto 3D Sign with the Toronto City Hall in the background. The fountain's arches are called \"The Freedom Arches\" that span over the pool/skating rink. At the base of the arches is a piece of the Berlin Wall. Conveniently accessible via Eaton Center along Bay Street (closest TTC Subway station would be Queen Station).",
      "Very nice area with the iconic Toronto sign overlooking it.  Arches and spouts for this 10in or so deep fountain.  Oh .. please don't climb the arches and don't fall in!  Lol",
      "Not great for skating. Gets too busy during evenings for it to be enjoyable, especially if you are a new skater. Also wouldn't recommend renting skates here, as the line tends to be very long.",
      "Beautiful square in downtown Toronto! Perfect for some photo op with family. From there you are in the center of old Toronto and can easily access some of the nicest spot in the city. I also recommend to head to Eaton Center from there for some nice A/C air during hot summer in Canada. The green path surrounding the square is really nice to visit and gives visitors some green space in the middle of the great city.",
      "Best place to visit with friends and family great hangout area . Restroom are worst be careful.  Skating during winter will be fun."

Having said that it is a great park with an ice rink softball diamond tennis courts community centre with a great outdoor fenced kids area, community garden and bike share terminal. It also is hang out area for the homeless consequently all of the park benches are gone to discourage \u201covernight guests \u201c. The neighbourhood is up and coming with many new condo developments near by. On its west end is an Armoury. In the years ahead the city is planning a complete makeover of the park which will also include its own subway station. Come back in 10 years to see the new park and gentrified neighbourhood. For now visit in the day and get great photos of the downtown towers especially just before sunset.",
      "This is my 6th year at Moss Park Community garden. The people are very friendly. If your a true gardener and your not expecting to feed your family from your harvest you'll do great. It is Moss Park after all. More pics to come...",
      "Not a safe place to hangout with kids. A lot of people with drug addiction around, especially on the eastern side where dollarama is located. It\u2019s really sad, Wish the city would do more to help these poor souls.",
      "Lots of facilities but areas a little colourful if not used to it",
      "We didn't really use the park, we used the tennis courts and it was great. There are only 2 courts but we didn't have to wait since only one was being used by another couple. They are clean and well maintained. We are definitely going back there at least two times per week."

      "This is not really a park. There is an inukshuk here and green space. Maybe some seating options if you sit on the rocks. This \"park\" is more of a connection between Coronation Park and Trillium Park. There is also a path to take you to the trail that runs alongside Lake Shore Blvd West.",
      "If you are looking for a park with a playground, this is not the place to go. However, it does have a very large and cool looking Inukshuk for photos. The stones around the Inukshuk are engraved, which provides additional information. I suggest walking the waterfront trail.",

You can play, walk, sit and relax, picnic with friends and family. It offers the shade of beautiful old trees and soft grass below your feet. Enjoy the best of nature close to home.",

However, great park overall to lounge in the sun or shade. Often will find merchants selling picnic blankets and other second hand items. Plenty of cycling room.",

      "Nice place to chill out in Toronto, but crowded on weekends. I dint got much time to explore the whole park but you can still find good decent place to hang around with friends and enjoy your weekend with peace. Dogs are allowed and be careful if you don't like them bcoz there will be always around with owners. A good picnic stop within the town. Parking is paid on streets and if you take a trnaist do not take form Ossinigton since it's crowded on weekends and frequent is very bad. You may need to walk to nearest station that is whatbi did Fter waiting for a bus for almost 1/2hr"

      "Nice place for some decent Italian food at a good price point. Really good portions as well.  Went here for dinner with one of my girlfriends on Friday after work. The location of the place isn\u2019t the most convenient, and kind of out of the way unless you drive. The restaurant has a paid green p parking lot for those are are driving there. The restaurant was quite empty when we came to dine, maybe because it\u2019s next to the exhibition place so I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d be more quaint during the winter and probably has more traffic in the summer when the exhibition place is occupied.  When we arrived at the restaurant, there was no hostess or anyone to seat us, maybe because they weren\u2019t busy so they didn\u2019t have many staff working. We seated ourselves since it was taking a bit. Once we sat down though, someone came to us with the menu and took our order in a timely manner. The menu options were small but well priced and food portions were big (I couldn\u2019t finish my food). The food was delicious and service throughout dinner was good. We also received complimentary dessert toward the end of our meal, which was a nice touch.  The decor for the place was really nice, very upscale vibes. Definitely a good space for hosting events as well.  I would come back to this place again if I\u2019m looking for a hearty portion of Italian food for a cheap price. Maybe in the summer, since they have a really nice patio but unfortunately we couldn\u2019t check it out this time because it\u2019s winter.",
      "We went here for Dinner and were very pleases.  The restaurant aesthetically was very nice. Clean and neat. The curved feature wall starting from the bar was beautiful.  We sat at a booth right by the large windows looking over Lake Ontario and CNE gardens. I could see this place being even nicer in the summer.  The service was great. Our waiter was polite and good with our kids.  We had a couple apps to start and then had 3 of the 4 of us get pizza and one get the steak. We were all.pleased as all.our plates were empty when we were done.  The wood oven pizza's were the perfect size and tasty.  We found this place as we were looking for a nice restaurant near Ontario Place because we were going to the Cirque Du Soleil. This restaurant was perfect for that as it was a 10 minute walk.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice Italian meal. We need to get this place put on the map because unfortunately due to where it is you really need to know that it is there because there is really no foot traffic or even car traffic.  It is literally connected to the back side of  the Bandshell on the CNE grounds.  I understand they even do events like wedding and stuff. I could see this a great place for a small intimate gatherings.  Oh and the Paper Plane cocktail was great too!  Thank you Acqua Dolce for a nice meal.  Would definitely come back!!!  Cheers!!",
      "This place was amazing! We went here before going to a Zac Brown Band concert. It was a very short walk from the Budweiser stadium!  The only thing that sucks for them is there isn\u2019t much foot or car traffic. There really was only one other group that walked in when we were dinning! It\u2019s honestly a hidden beauty! I definitely recommend going if you\u2019re ever looking for a delicious authentic italien meal!  Food: everything we ordered was delicious and Homemade. No food was left on the plates! We ordered some pizzas, gnocchi and spaghetti which were all good! The best thing was the pizza \u00ab\u00a0Porri E Pancetta\u00a0\u00bb. We easily agreed this was in fact the best flat bread pizza we had ever eaten!  We got some free chocolates while leaving and let me tell you they were amazing! And like everything else on the menu they were homemade.  Service: first off the staff was nothing but welcoming! We loved to chat with them as we were the only ones there. They were very quick. Our food was on the table within 15mins! And we ordered 6 things as we are a family of five and had to taste at least one appetizer! Overall amazing staff and service!  Atmosphere: This place is beautiful! With the amazing decor and amazing view! I love the beautiful red piano and all the wood designs! There was great little music in the background! And very comfy booths\ud83d\ude02  Prices: everything was reasonably priced! And all worth the amount paid!  Thank you Acqua Dolce for the amazing night!",
      "Absolutely delicious pasta! Would definitely dine here again. It's also super close to Budweiser Stage and BMO Field. Service was excellent!",
      "Had an amazing experience here last night before going to TIFF. Beautiful restaurant with kind hearted staff. I had called the restaurant before arriving asking about parking. They mentioned they had a small lot just for guests so that\u2019s where we parked. After dinner we came out to get in our cars and were greeted by city parking authority ticketing our vehicles with absolutely no right to do so. After arguing with the security for over 10 minutes, Amelia (I believe the chef) came out to deal with our situation promptly. She turned our night around and made sure we didn\u2019t leave with tickets. We were blown away with her hospitality and kindness. Thank you Amelia! We will be back."

She communicates frequently, sending many pictures, videos and comments throughout every walk as well as letting us know once he is picked up and dropped off. She is extremely accommodating as well, flexible with us as we have evolving needs. She has helped our dog immensely become a better walker and overall better trained. Our dog is excited to see her everyday and loves his walks with her and his pack of friends.",

He has stayed at Alison's numerous times when I have gone away and has thoroughly enjoyed himself on her couch! He certainly feels at home there and my mind is always at ease knowing that he is being cared for and loved. He goes on group outings twice per week and has a blast with his doggie friends. I can't say enough good things about these wonderful, compassionate people. I am so grateful to have them in our lives.",
      "Our 2 year-old, super high-energy Husky-shepherd cross has been attending doggy day care at Alison's for over 1.5 years. Hands-down, Alison is the absolute BEST in the industry!  We have employed other name-brand commercial establishments in the past, but they all pale in comparison to the personal, intimate, hands-on, outdoor,  social experience every canine deserves, desires, and experiences while in Alison's care. The other dogs are well-vetted; all dogs are excercised daily (at length) at a free-run local farm and/or leash-free dogparks; and taken on leashed walks rain, snow, or shine!!! Alison also adheres to any dietary restrictions outlined during her intake meeting. We receive almost hourly updates of photos and videos of our happy pup as he runs, swims, and naps with his friends, all under the direct care and supervision of Alison et al. I 100% recommend Alison Unleashed to everyone I meet as she is trusted, personable, reliable, and has a deep personal connection with all of the dogs she cares for. Alison has become a part of our family, and as shift workers, we can not begin to express our gratitude to her. Alison has gone above and beyond for our pup and we guarantee she will do the same for yours.",
      "Alison has provided wonderful care to our dogs, Jewel & Teddy and our cats Patches & Cleo over the years when we have been away. We have had pets with special health needs and it has been comforting to know that they are in good hands while we are on vacation. She went above and beyond, taking our kitty to her house for visits, so she would have company for a time each day.  Alison is reliable and professional. We would highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a caring and dependable person to help care for their pets.",
      "I recently got a cockapoo puppy and I am SO pleased that I decided to go with Alison to board my puppy with. I contacted a few kennels and boarding facilities in the Hamilton and Burlington area, and after meeting with a few, I decided to go with Alison. Within a few minutes of meeting with her, you could tell that she is passionate about animals. I left my little Brodi with Alison for 4 days and within those days, I received regular picture/video text messages to help put me at ease while I was away travelling for work. Since he is a puppy, Alison was very attentive to his needs and even helped me to continue with his training while I was away. I travel quite often for work and I will be using Alison's boarding services from now on for my little Brodi. Amazing service and amazing experience!"

On a warm sunny afternoon, its great to sit on the bench near the central water fountain and people watch. Many people grab a beer or two from the next door LCBO and chat with friends after work. The grass is not well kept, but is acceptable. There are often sketchy homeless people drinking in this park, but they are pretty harmless.",
      "My dog hates it here. It\u2019s probably the ice cold people and poorly socialised dogs. But hey, it\u2019s a leash free dog park, so that\u2019s something."

      "This is a very unusual wooded park, tucked in a quiet residential area. Though it is a small park, it has many interesting features. A fountain with a large play area, a chess board table, many benches and an interesting sculpture dedicated to a local community member who had helped the people in the area in many ways. The park is named after her.",

There is a long trail for walking and cycling to travel around the island. There are parks and little areas to rest and picnic. There is even a shoreline to access the lake to swim (too many rocks to be considered a beach). Overall, this is a good outdoor space.",

Centre piece is the Budweiser Stage! Good venue! But being the old buy, I miss the old rotating stage. But that is me! Good place to visit and take the kids ( or not )",

Well , it's a bit sad to see white paint is covered with rust spots...and pavilions are left in poor conditions.  The architecture is still a sight to behold after all these years.",

People have left their old toys there so lots of things for kiddos to play with.  The rest of the park is nice and chill but it definitely needs an enclosed dog park as lots of people let their dogs of leash.   The grass alsol needs a reseeding  in spots.",

      "This is a fairly big park. There is a dog run for dogs and a playground for kids. My daughter likes the playground. However, there aren't many things to do here so it gets boring for her after 5 minutes. There are better playgrounds in downtown Toronto so I don't know why this playground got short changed. There is also a field with artificial turf here. It's for the school mainly. However, when school isn't in session it is free to use. Unfortunately, that doesn't extend to dogs. Some dog owners don't care and will unleash their dogs here. Very dangerous.",

Contains a rare public turf soccer field, basketball courts adjacent to the community centre and a dog park. A variety of terrains and world-class Toronto views give energy to any visitors. Also, one of the few water fountains remaining in the area.",

Based on the three times I\u2019ve been there, it\u2019s more common for smaller dogs to play in the field outside of the gated zone; as larger dogs tend to spend more time there. The pool was also nice in the summertime.",

      "Group of Karens spotted at the dog park. Their dog would not stop mounting ours and these people did nothing to stop it, until we asked them to.  When we asked them to watch their dog, their response was \u201cthis is a dog park, if you don\u2019t want your dog to be mounted then hold on to your dog\u201d followed by a bunch of expletives. It\u2019s unbelievable how people who have zero dog park etiquette bring their dogs who show aggressive behaviours that can easily escalate if not intervened, and they have the audacity to swear at you for trying to protect your dog. Apparently because \u201cno mounting\u201d is not a written rule, these people believe that it is accepted.",

      "Very nice park! One of the best free park that I have ever seen. Especially during cherry blossom season! People is packed during weekends so better go during weekdays to appreciate the nature and peacefulness of the place. It does not feel that it was situated inside a city. Finding a place to park your car near the park is kinda difficult, we have to park near the lake and walk which is okay since the weather is good. We will definitely go back! You also have to walk to find restaurants",
      "It may be the best park in Toronto! It's suitable for hiking or walking dogs in summer, and there are many facilities and trails to choose from. There are a zoo, nature trails, and a dog walks area, a swimming pool, a tennis court, playgrounds, and many trees! There are a lot of parking spaces here and many shared bicycles to rent. It is also convenient to have a subway station next to the park. We visited this park for the first time and had a great afternoon here.",
      "High park is my favourite part of Toronto especially when you want surround yourself with nature without getting out Toronto. Fall is so stunning here. There are lots of small trains for a easy hike in the park. And btw, this park is huge, with a beautiful lake with swans and ducks. Must visit if you are a tourist, or looking to go for a trail run or just to spend some peaceful time in nature. Heads-up: weekend can be busy, especially in summers and everyone is here taking lots of pictures.",
      "It\u2019s beautiful. Very nice place to hangout with friends, family or alone if you like. You can see various types of bird, goose, swans. On top you will find parking, washroom, food place for convenience (not sure if they are open around the year). Rent a bicycle or walk around to see beautiful nature. Only issue I would say it\u2019s busy sometime",
      "It's a huge park, very beautiful and great for a lot of activities. Parking inside is closed during weekends, nearby street parking is usually full and finding a spot becomes bit of a hassle sometimes and has 3 hours limit. But once you get inside, it's great for spending time with family in a beautiful natrual serene environment. Great for a walk, cycling, picnic with friends and family, there's also a free zoo where kids enjoy watching and interacting with the animals. It's specially beautiful during the cherry blossom season and offers great spots for taking beautiful pictures. The play area is also great for kids of all ages. Overall it's one of the best parks in the city!"

I was so pleasantly surprised and then realized that the mountain goat was true to it's name - it climbed the top of the little wooden shed. Wish they had more animals. A beautiful spot to visit in the fall!",

      "I love this dog park and trail! I would recommend trying to avoid peak hours since it does get quite busy but most of the people and dogs I've met here are super friendly and the trails are wide and fenced-in. One of my favorite dog-friendly places in the city!",
      "Great hiking, the biggest off leash area in Toronto, you can easily lost your dog among the tries there :)  There were many dogs on Monday, so I can imagine how many it is going to be on a weekend.  Take some water for our dog, because there is no such facility in the off leash park.  There are some places to seat add relaxso you can bring anything you would like, from a book to make a picnic.  There was a lot of squirrels, if your dog doesn't like them us mine, make sure to follow him along the way :)",
      "Was smaller than I expected and a lot of the ground is sand; so my white dog needed a bath as soon as we got home. Other than that we had a great time there. I loved the forest area and so did the dogs. Water was on already so that was a bonus, as we have been bringing our own water to dog parks since it\u2019s still only spring. Will definitely go again but only on bath days.",
      "Great trail and wooded area with friendly dogs and owners! Moderately busy with lots of folks walking with and without pups."

There are many benches placed in garden for sitting with lake view. A good place to bring kids. No public washrooms are available at site. The parking lot near this place is pay and park.",

      "There is plenty of parking to start off. There is plenty of space at this dog park, enough shade for the hot days, and benches for owners. The park is comprised of mostly sand. There are plenty of pups to socialize with throughout the day, due to the fact that the majority of visitors are dog walkers. The one thing missing is a drinking fountain for dogs, do not forget your water bottle.",
      "Lovely big dog park close to the city and right by the lake.",
      "I love the Sir Casimir dog park. I'm there several times a week. It's fenced with two double gated entrances and there are plenty of garbage and recycling containers as well as several well-maintained benches. It's set away from the bike path so the surrounding area is quieter.  The fence is a bit low so if you have a dog that jumps fences, take care. There is also no water access for the dogs although there is a water fountain on the path between the bike path and the park that's handy for refilling water containers.  The ground is sand so you can avoid the mud that can become a problem in most dog parks and almost everyone is careful about cleaning up after the dogs. It is frequented by great dog walkers during the day.",
      "Named after Sir Kazimierz Stanislaus Gzowski. An engineer best known for his work on Canadian railways, the Welland Canal and also serving as acting Lieutenant Governor of Ontario... and possible dog lover?  Oddly shaped off leash dog area with soft sand underfoot, so no winter mud in this one.  Few benches to chill on while your dog checks out the butts on offer.  Something to note and a possible problem for our nervous four legged friends. Dog walkers use this park a lot! Mostly during the week, you can have more than one with 4-5 dogs each.  Although always friendly but sometimes manic and in very large groups, if you dog is nervous, they can have a hard time here.",
      "Fortunately it\u2019s close to my house, unfortunately it\u2019s also for commercial dog walkers that flood this place at all times of the day. I\u2019m not a pretentious dog owner and i appreciate dogs will be dog but a lot of these walkers have no licenses and literally take any kind of dog. A lot with some attitude problems (dogs & walkers alike). Also the gravel and lack of shade make it one of the less favourable places to bring your dog to run."

      "A great place to enjoy nature as it is. The walking trail is natural with multiple humanmade wooden bridges over water bodies. You can walk up to the top to have a better view of the entire place. Great place to go alone, with friend or family. They don't have toilets everywhere so make sure to visit one at the building one before going in or after coming out. The bus stops right at the parking lot. They also have a cafe at the entrance building but they close up by 5 pm. The sound of the leaves when the wind goes through then is what I found most amazing about this place. The place is quiet even though there were a lot of people with kids and pets.",
      "Lots of trails to enjoy a quick hike.. still so close to the city but feels like you're in a forest. The views of the city are also fantastic from here. We always bike here and find it quite challenging to dock our bike share bikes. It's great that there's bike path all the way here. There's always a farmer's market or vintage clothes going on here. So it's super vibrant but pretty expensive. We love it and visit in all seasons except in winter of course. Fall and spring are particularly beautiful.",
      "I recently visited this place for the first time and loved it! What an awesome way to keep the history alive while breathing in life into it. I plan on coming back during their Saturday market but the Sunday I went was beautiful. It was a great day to go walking on their paths, reading about the history and learning about the wildlife. There needs to be more places like this that help us reconnect to nature.",
      "Well maintained paved trails at the top and bottom level with nature all around! Going up to the top starting from the right side (or left, it's a loop) gives a great view of the hills and the city skyline. Once you reach the Don Valley Parks lookout, there's a small dirt path that takes you to the railway tracks. The path also connects to the Beltline trail.  There is a small shop containing lots of knickknacks and potential souvenirs at the main entrance area. The cafe is also a lovely place to get refreshments or a meal. Plenty of seats and picnic tables around as well, although it does get crowded during popular times in autumn.",
      "One of Toronto\u2019s true gems, this urban oasis has it all. Great walking paths, tons of wildlife and a real sense of nature in the middle of our city. On a daily basis in the spring and summer you\u2019ll see turtles, frogs, snakes and a plethora of birds.  Originally where most of the bricks in Toronto came from this amazing place has been transformed.  The farmers market in the summer months is a huge bonus. From fresh strawberries to delicious street food and if you\u2019re lucky a live music performance I highly recommend a trip to the Brick works."

The place is very well maintained, there are beautiful trees all over, play ground for kids, a big wide open field for kids to run around, or for people to chill. There a pretty big dog area as well, for all the dog owners and dog lovers to come around. I personally love to come here on days off just to look at dogs interacting. This park gives me a sense of peace, everyone seems to enjoy their time here. One of the best community parks in East York area. Definetly worth a visit, especially now with all the foliage.",

Repaving is overdue on many points along the trail, particularly near Riverdale Park.",

Endless areas to walk, bike, even mountain bikes in the area. Great for families, children and furry kids. Trails are plenty wide enough to social distance and really not that many people can be seen as the trails are off in many different directions. You can travel north or south, towards the Brick Works or away from that area. You can cross the Don River over a foot pedestrian bridge and or walk along the small water side trails."

There is a running track for those looking to get moving as well as enough space to place soccer.",

      "I give the park and the Lower Don River Trail 4 star for it's natural beauty and the way it's kept untouched at the heart of the city. But I got one star back because there are no seats or any washroom facility along the trail (unless we get further off the trail).  I understand that we don't want to disrupt the natural environment by construction, though, at least seats along the trail at safe places and environmentally-friendly structures and washrooms do help to attract more people and the ones who can't walk long trails without getting rest along the way on seats.  This good trail also needs more access by providing more entry paths to the park from all neighbourhoods around the area.",

      "Perfect place for a Park with so much foot traffic and or bikes traveling the trails of the Don River. Just needs some picnic tables for the summer months. We made our way from Riverdale Park West today and hiked along the Don River up as far as Pottery Road and so much has changed over the years. I miss that wooden structure that we used to walk or bike on that passed under the bridges. Now the trail takes you away from the 2 bridges and no sign of the past.",
      "The bike trail from Canary District is a great cycling workout along the River. Many cyclists along the way. The trail is located within the city, and in the summer, it gives you a feeling of riding in the villages of India. Didn\u2019t see any wildlife other than the insects that fly into your mouth and nose while cycling. Try to get done with the trail way before sunset to avoid the insects.",

On nice days, the park will be full of people given the amenities: Ping pong/table tennis table Baseball diamond Tennis court Children's playground with swings and climbing structure Small splash pad Small garden Free book exchange Public washrooms  There's also a public bike rental in this park.",

Oriole park near davisville subway station is a fantastic clean park for kids. My daughter loved open space, greenery and the water splash area where kids love to cool down. It also has couple of tennis courts and a very unique table tennis table and lots of space for jogging.",

There's a baseball diamond, a playground, benches, and a ping pong table (paddles and balls not provided, of course).  On the weekends it gets fairly busy, and during the warmer seasons, there are often peewee baseball games (which can get loud, be mindful of this if you're seeking serenity).  This park connects to bicycle routes in all cardinal directions, including the beltline trail."

The playground has soft \"cork-style\" flooring to protect children who fall.  The large splash pool is to one side with two levels of equipment for small and older children. At present, only the washrooms located beyond the tennis courts are open. The men's room has very strong urine scent. Some of the equipment is not the \"standard\" city equipment which makes it attractive to kids. The playground is wheelchair accessible and so are the washrooms. There are also 2 basketball courts, an outdoor hockey rink and a baseball diamond.",

There plenty of trees to provide shade, picnic tables and other benches. A good place to spend a couple of hours relaxing or getting some excercise!",
      "It's an impressive park with lots of public facilities. There's rubber trails on the park to ease your walk, there's kids playground and basketball park not far from each other. This park is quite the size, they even have 8 tennis courts and a descent dog park. The neighborhood seems nice and quiet as well. The only downside is their washroom is poorly maintained as the smell so horrible I had to put my mask on coming in. Overall, one of the nice park we have in TO."

Every winter, around Christmas time they host the Cavalcade of Lights with beautiful Christmas light displays.  In the winter they also have the ice sculptures located here (February I believe) and they\u2019ll have the Festival of Lights and different themed events here throughout the year.  Centrally located in Yorkville, there are lots of coffee shops and restaurants to grab a snack and make a day out of it with some great shopping.  This is a fun place to bring the family whether you\u2019re from Toronto or visiting, if you happen to catch an event at the park, chances are it will be well lit and picture perfect!!",
      "A beautiful park right in the heart of Yorkville village. Right on the top of the Bay subway station it's well connected to all the places. It has some amazing restaurants and shopping centres surrounding the park. Several festivals are held at this park, Yorkville Christmas holiday, ice sculpture festival etc.",
      "Lovely park in the middle of Downtown, surrounded by the best stores of the city. With a boulder that is over a billion years and diferent sections, it's a little oasis, great to take the kids or enjoy a quiet time in your day relaxing with a cup of tea or coffee. Beautiful Christmas lights and decorations turn it into a Winter Wonderland on this Holiday season.",

Only thing that I would change is the size of the park. It is pretty small compared to some other parks and would greatly benefit from being bigger or additional trails.",
      "Nice trail with natural springs and brooks. Lots of stiff heights for those who want rigorous cardio. Within town (just 5 mins walk from st Clair) but still feels like deep forest remote area once entered \u2026. Beware of slips and trips due to no maintenance",
      "This park is beautiful, well maintained and so refreshing. There's a ravine trail that connects from the little park besides, and this park as well. It's just an amazing experience. It's green, beautiful and lush. Although I think a little bit maintenance is required in some parts of it.",
      "I can't believe it took so long to discover the David Balfour Park trail and Yellow Creek. This hike follows several trail connections and we decided to follow it south,  down to the Mud Creek trail - aka the Brickworks - so that we could turn back up and create a loop. For a truly inner city hike, I give this a score of 4.5. The trail is mostly packed ground and well maintained but our route did have a couple of exciting crossings of Mount Pleasant Ave. that require attention and care.  Easy to get your steps in, a few mostly gentle inclines and great tree canopies that keep you shaded for most of the hike.  And how many hikes end with a reflection on life as our loop took us through the cemetery to finish off the day. Just shy of 10 k but you can easily do more.  We loved the last set of stairs that end it off. - NOT! \ud83d\ude01"

I did bring a bunch of unneeded items and left with some items that could make my home better. Overall an average experience.",

      "Neat park, tucked in the Junction triangle. Kiddo plays in a soccer league there and she greatly enjoys it. There is a wadding pool/splash feature and a playground as well as a hockey rink. Everything I've gone there is young adults having a good time either playing soccer or picnic-ing",
      "Nice little park in the block. Nicely maintained field.",
      "The playground area covered in sand; nice and soft. If your kids love to play with sand this is the one! This place also has wading pool during summer time which is very nice!!! Its open from 12-7pm but come at around 1.30. They should be done with putting chemical in the pool around that time.",

      "This quiet little park is a hidden gem. There is a fun splash pad for the kids and lots of grass (both shaded and unshaded) for picnicers or sunbathers. There's a Dominos and Tacos Gus just up the street so you aren't far from food. There are swings and other playground equipment for the kids, too. I recommend this place.",

It is a great place for a picnic, and it has public bathrooms. Clean, well kept, and also a nice walkway for baby carriages."

      "Love the play ground here great for older kids and for toddlers and loved that its a sand park my kids favorite.",
      "A hidden gem. The wading pool is relatively warm because it gets full sun all day, but there's lots of shade to be found nearby. The playground equipment is good for kids of all ages and having a sand surface for the entire playground is a bonus. No washroom, but there is a port-a-potty, which is better than nothing.",
      "The play structures are great and suit a variety of ages. There is a splash pad in the summer (just a kiddie pool, no fountains or spraying structures), and the splash pad is equipped with lifeguards hired by the city of Toronto. There are picnic tables and plenty of shade. The park is great! I only wish there was a real washroom here (and not a port-a-potty).",

      "Great place to let your fur baby unleash energy. Friendly neighbors and a great place to socialize your dogs. Easily 4 acres of fenced in wood chipped floor, complete with rakes and water fountain. Fountain is currently off but there's a 10 gallon bucket with a water bowl which frequent dog owners keep full. Filled it once myself. Two double gated entrances and lots of refuse bins. Lots of shade from mature trees keeps the hot sun off you and your dogs. Only bad thing is there is only one picnic table with seating for three, and a regular bench at the northern entrance. Overall a great place to let your dog be a dog. Fountain is now working.",
      "Great park for if u live near it and can't drive to high park .has the wood chips so it helps after rain .does have it's muddy spots.",
      "Well shaded with mature trees and a pleasant group of responsible dog owners. Space to run, securely fenced from the rest of the park. Fence is low in places if you have a very large and agile dog but never had an issue with mine (who regularly jumps the cedarvale fence).",
      "Great park. Has a pool, community center, large outdoor track, exercise fixtures, kids play equipment, etc. Since the park is elevated, it has trees and vegetation around the perimeters so it gives the park and \"outside city\" feel.",
      "Beautiful community area for all ages. I went to the library to work, then had lunch outside by the track field, and in the evening I went to the swimming pool. All in one place!"

      "TLDR: It's a great park with lots of green space that is well maintained. Rinks, running track, basketball courts, baseball diamond, soccer pitch, playground, gazebo, and lots of space to sit.  Earlscourt has been a life-saver for having access to well maintained green space in York.  Complete with a variety of sport amenities (basketball, baseball, soccer, ice rink, swimming pool, running track, small workout area] a playground, a small splashpad and an off leash dog area.  Even with all these amenities the greatest perk of Earlscourt is just the scale of green space you have to set-up a picnic, lay out in the sun, or for myself draw some of the local buildings is fantastic in this part of York.  If you want a little escape from the stretches of concrete in every direction around it, Earlscourt is a great spot for a little break in your day.  (Next time I'm down in good weather I'll grab some pictures)",

      "One of my favourite places in the entire city. A must visit whether you\u2019re a local or a tourist coming in - so full of fresh produce and locally made, high quality goods! An absolute gem of a place, there is something special for everyone.  Come early to beat the morning crowd on Saturday mornings (and to get your first pick of the in-season goods)!!! I will continue to visit this iconic spot whenever I get the chance, especially as opening hours have recently been extended.",
      "Cool place!!! So many options to choose from here. Indoor Venue reminds me of a local farmers market; indoors with 2 floors and with tons of vendors selling everything from meats, cheeses, syrup, seafood, souvenirs, various hot food options, desserts and more. Found a bunch of great options. My family grabbed lunch from various places. Crossed this spot off of our Toronto list. Happy we stopped for the experience.  Note: I recommend more seating/dining options.",
      "Visited the market with a group of 6 on a Thursday afternoon. Walked around and looked at all the inner shops and stands. Mostly fresh produce/fish/ingredients but also a handful of food/meal spots to choose from. We enjoyed a variety of dishes (pizza, oysters, Chinese food, meat pies, and pastries). Very clean and easy to navigate. Loved visiting this adorable market!",
      "All seafood products were worth every penny!! Everything we got was super fresh and yummy as always. Best spot for fresh seafood and the fun atmosphere  They will ship out the fresh seafood to your place for you. It isn't cheap but great quality seafood products and fresh vegetable.  Have shipped it back a few times and love the tiger shrimp and oysters.",
      "This is a must to visit place when in downtown. The have all fresh fruits and vegetables, kitchen accessories, fresh meats and many local items. The space is really clean and organized. You can buy good from there and there are ample seats inside as well as outside the market. The food is of high quality, mostly organic and you can buy it in the amount you want unlike the big packaging in super store. This market is on my list always."

      "Great place for anyone visiting Toronto or even staying here. The rotating restaurant is great. Although you may feel dizzy for a few minutes but the experience is at another level. The food here is probably the best in town, tried different dishes and they were all done to the highest of standards. The staff are very knowledgeable and very friendly. This is a great spot for a birthday, anniversary or any special occasion.",
      "Nice experience. Awesome view of Downtown Toronto, Old Toronto, and Lake Ontario. Can easily spend around 40 minutes including taking videos. Elevator ride is good. Better to arrive before 11 am to beat the rush and always precook the tickets. Or else the lines can stretch to half kilometers",
      "Love the CN tower. One of my favorite touristy spots to show around when friends and family come to visit. Great views of the Lake on one side and the downtown on other side. Also able to view the Billy Bishop airport with planes landing there often. Prefer to go during the night time to soak in the City lights but great views during the day time as well. Would recommend buying tickets online instead of standing in the line there.",
      "Wonderful! I went up the elevator, it takes around a minute to get to the top. A person will tell you a little about the CN Tower on the way. The view from up there is wonderful! The glass floor is extremely cool. It's amazing! I didn't go to the restaurant, but there is a revolving restaurant up there too. The gift shop is great too! Nothing is too overpriced. I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves taking photos or for a weekend activity. There is also a light show every night, which looks extremely cool.",
      "The CN Tower is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Toronto and for good reason. It offers stunning views of the city skyline and is home to many different restaurants and attractions. The tower is also a great place to learn about the history of Toronto and the CN Railway. The first thing you'll notice when you visit the CN Tower is its size. Standing at 553 meters tall, it's the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere. The tower also has the world's highest glass floor and is the fifth-tallest building in the world.  Once you take the elevator up to the top of the tower, you'll be treated to stunning views of Toronto and the surrounding area. On a clear day, you can see for over 100 kilometers.  The tower also has a number of different restaurants and cafes, so you can grab a bite to eat while you enjoy the views. If you're interested in learning about the history of the CN Tower, there's a great exhibit at the base of the tower. The exhibit tells the story of how the tower was built and how it has become such an iconic part of Toronto's skyline.  Whether you're looking for stunning views, great food, or a bit of history, the CN Tower is a must-visit when you're in Toronto."

      "Sep 2022 We were staying at the Sheraton and had great views of City Hall from our room. Quite a modern and unusual shaped building. Found in the square with the large Toronto city sign with lake and fountain. Popular spot with tourists and must be photographed with the sign.",
      "Our Toronto City Hall is in the shape of a UFO!  That alone puts it on the map for a destination location.  Nathan Philip Square boasts the public skating rink in the winter as well as a huge Christmas Tree, which has been a holiday tradition for as long as I can remember.  In the summer the NPS hosts numerous events and on Queen Street you\u2019ll find a vast array of food trucks.  I have attended my best friends wedding at City Hall and when you leave the space ship, well, there are those moments where you feel transported at times.  The Toronto sign along with the Indigenous Wheel and Maple Leaf, those are photo ops waiting to happen.  If you\u2019re visiting Toronto I highly recommend City Hall and Nathan Philip Square for some classic but distinguishable tourist shots and if you live here, same rules apply!  \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udef8\ud83c\udf41",
      "Must Visit if you\u2019re in Toronto! You get the actual city vibe and what Toronto stands for with it\u2019s multiculturalism at it\u2019s centre.  With an ice skating rink, you get to indulge in a winter activities right at the centre. Great open space to just spend time alone or meet friends and family  Ofcourse when you\u2019re here you won\u2019t miss the TORONTO sign!  Enjoy Toronto at it\u2019s finest.",

      "Oh it was an amazing experience. Walking around seeing all the great scenes and items hanging on display. The shot the puck and shootout were fun for the family. The main item was walking up the stairs into the great Hall. The presentation of the trophies and all the hall of fame walls was amazing. The staff members that took my family picture with the cup was great to talk to, as he even knew the Windsor area where we were from. He was talking like he still lives there and how he went to University and watched lots of hockey. It was a great way to experience everything.",
      "I had a blast here, such an awesome Hall of Fame and a true honor to hockey. Has the humble beginnings of hockey from back in the 1890\u2019s, and brings it forward to the last Stanley Cup Champions Colorado Avalanche. Tons of history, not just NHL, but Olympics, Women\u2019s, Minor leagues and international leagues. Loved the summit section, such history there. The mask exhibit was cool with a nice shout to Plante for being the first to insist on a mask. Plenty of things for kids too, interactive shootouts and also goaltending drills. Had a wonderful time and for $20 or so a person it\u2019s a superb value. The gift shop at the end is also nice, nothing outrageously priced.",
      "What an amazing display.  Our game is represented in the most amazing way, as is the international game.  Featured 9 & 99 display was super cool... 2 of the very best ever.  If you like hockey... even a little bit... thisbis worth a stop.  You'll need a couple hours though,  it's a BIG display.",
      "What a cool experience for any hockey fan! Amazing displays, plenty of history and memorabilia. Enjoyed the 9 & 99 featured display, two of the best to ever play the game. You can get your photo taken with the Stanley Cup for a small fee.  Interactive games can get quite busy. There's plenty to see for all ages, I'd budget about 2 hours here as there is a lot to see!",
      "Really cool place! I really enjoyed it. First time in Toronto. Great experience if you are a sports fan!  You'll need at least an hour to get through the exhibits."

      "We went to this museum on a weekday and it was still a little busy but still nice. When you\u2019re below 25, you have to register to an annual pass which is free but still takes up a few minutes. The museum in itself was not really my favorite because it had too much of contemporary art which I\u2019m not so fond of. Otherwise, the floor with the miniature boat collection is really nice and the back stairs (accessible from the third and fourth floors) are worth going to admire the view from there. During our visit, there was a nice temporary exhibition which was really nice and intriguing and it seems like they have a nice set of these temp exhibitions !",
      "Where do I even begin?!  I got to the gallery at 3pm, thinking 2.5hrs would be enough time to finish the exhibit. (The gallery closes at 5:30pm)  Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t.  I barely made it through the first floor alone. \ud83d\ude2d will definitely be back though!!  If you can, make a day of it or get the annual pass for an additional $10 (day pass is $25).  In my case, I was only in town for a short visit so didn\u2019t make sense for me to get the annual pass.",
      "A huge 5 level of gallery with amazing arts, models, painting and sculpture by different artists. Every room has a story to tell and one can easily spend an hour just in one section. Make sure to eat well and have ample time with you to visit the gallery. Also, they have a stand where you can keep your coat and bag otherwise if you are carrying a backpack, you have to carry it either on the front or the side but not in the back.  I would recommend to get the tickets online or if you are a member of Toronto Public Library you can avail free passes every Saturday.  Overall, a lovely experience.",
      "Great gallery.  Very pleased at the wide selection of art in the collection, including Canadian art, Indigenous art, and foreign art.  The temporary exhibits are also well done.  It\u2019s also always free for people under 25, which is a great way to get young people involved in the arts!  Tickets should be purchased online in advance even if you are under 25, as you may need to wait for an email confirmation.",
      "I spent approximately four hours in the museum just checking out the ground floor. There were four other levels that I didn't have the time to visit. There's A LOT to see here. It's worth it. Just make sure you have ample time to make the most out of it. There's even a restaurant and a gift shop, so you can pretty much spend most of your day here."

      "The Toronto City Hall also known as the New City Hall took 4 years to build. It was built on land that was once housed by Toronto's first Chinatown. It looks futuristic, so it appeared in several movies such as Resident Evil.  Our City Hall consists of 2 curve shaped office towers with one of those 2 towers higher than the other by 7 storeys high. At the centre of it is a dome shaped roof. From the sky looking down,\u00a0it looks like \"an unblinking eye.\"  Right in front is the Nathan Phillips Square, an open place where one can enjoy many free public events like New Year's Eve celebrations, Canada Day's Fireworks, Nuit Blanche, etc. There is a non wading pool off to one side that is converted into a skating rink during the Winter.  One can find the famous LED TORONTO sign here. It was temporarily installed for the 2015 Pan Am Games, because of its popularity amongst the Tourists and the Locals, a permanent one was unveiled to the City in September 2020 during the pandemic. It started off with the City's name, TORONTO, then a \ud83c\udf41 leaf was added to it in December 2016.  There is a paid underground parking available at this site accessible off Bay Street. There is a public library located inside City Hall with washroom facilities. You can get here too through the underground PATH walking system. The Queen Subway Station is within walking distance to this location, and so is the famous multilevel Eaton Center Mall.  The last 2 photos were taken this month during one of those cultural food venues. The rest of the photos were taken earlier this year in April 2022.",
      "This is a must day trip for the ice skating fan! It will become a once a year tradition for sure.  Ice is always nice and smooth, lots of spots to get ready. You can rent skates or bring your own, parking underneath / underground is always reasonable on the weekend.   The other best part is it\u2019s cloister to shopping and great spots to go for food after.",
      "Nathan Philips Square ...Whatever be the event this place never disappoints ...Every event here is celebrated in a king style...We went here on 26th Dec Night and we totally were aghast with the lights it had decorated with...  The most famous word /letters of the city \"Toronto\" was shining bright and we didn't leave the chance to click few photos here.  Many kids and youngsters were also skating in the big ring... Decent crowd... With some good food option of coffee and sandwiches to relish on... Some special heart accent lights with heart was a special attraction of this place this time....  Not sure if its still around but if it is...Don't miss a chance....You will love it for sure",
      "A celebration spot or point in downtown Toronto, a nice spot with Toronto sign and signature buildings around it. There is hero burger spot and you will find some food trucks around it. You will feel steep sun rays during summer and will find a skating place in winter. A little garden on one side of square"

At first, it looked like a regular building, but when you go inside you submerged into the 1830's. The place was small, but the best museum to visit. You get to use featured ink pen to write your name and sand it off to dry it, as how people used to do. The staffs were very patience and nice, I got traditional seal wax on my postcards, which were unique. A must go place to explore",

The two ladies who gave the presentation shared incredible insight on the history behind the printing press and our first \u2018rebel mayor.\u2019 They also guided us through the steps in making our own posters and bookmarks which we were able to take home. Overall, a fun while educational experience for the kids and myself.",

Vanna did a great job - there were only two of us, so it was essentially a private tour. She also talked about others who printed local newspapers, like Mary Ann Shadd, who has quite a story of her own. It was interesting thinking about the process that used to be used to print and communicate.",

      "Went there for the doors open event. The building is well maintained. There were performances in the great hall on the 3rd floor at the time we were there. The visitors were allowed to watch them. The place has an interesting history and significance. I gave an additional star for the volunteers who were very friendly and warm.",

      "Visited this space for the first time this spring as a part of Doors Open Toronto. The history is very interesting and the pink room is stunning!",
      "If you want to see a vintage touch of Toronto then you must visit this Mansion. I was lucky to attend an event there and I was mesmerized with the immense experience I got there when it comes to look and feel of the hall. I did somehow cannot find the exterior picture of the hall and I would surely update when I found or click one asap but all I can say is- beautiful.",
      "The historic plaque in front of the building reads:  St. Lawrence Hall, one of the oldest public buildings in Toronto, was constructed following the Great Fire of 1849 that destroyed a large part of the city's core. Architect William Thomas designed the building in the Renaissance Revival style with Corinthian columns and a domed cupola.  The entrance originally led to a shopping arcade connected to the St. Lawrence Market. The building had shops on the main floor and, on the upper floors, offices and a grand meeting hall used for social events and by prominent speakers, performers, and musicians. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, and showman P.T. Barnum all appeared in the hall, as did William Lyon Mackenzie, Toronto's first mayor and Upper Canada Rebellion leader.  In the 20th century, St. Lawrence Hall lost prominence and fell into disrepair. By 1965, it was partially derelict and threatened with demolition. A campaign led by architect Eric Arthur resulted in the restoration of the building and its recognition as a National Historic Site in 1967."

      "Not sure what this place is supposed to be. A theatre? A community centre? A rink in Philadelphia? We came here for a \"performance\" or a \"concert\". While this place isn't responsible for my bleeding ears, the event lasted two hours. The seats are not comfortable in the slightest. I'm not expecting movie theatre seats or gaming chairs or whatever... But still. The sound was good, a bit loud, but that's the fault of the event organizers. Aside from that, everything was clean. The washrooms were also relatively clean.",
      "Enjoyed the reception and performance at this artist centre.  The local ladies prepared the eats (samosas, kebabs, empanadas), which were delightful and served with a friendly smile.  The performance was also fine, especially the neighbourhood kids' dancing.  Top notch!  Parking is a problem & TTC is erratic.  We got a lift home.  Have had previous dealings with Daniels Corp., which I won't share here.",

      "Just an awesome baseball stadium.   We were here in August 2022 and they opened the roof, which was pretty great.  We had foot long hot dogs and bottomless popcorn.  Doesn't seem to have any bad seats.  If you are there for a day game and they open the roof, I would suggest sitting on the 3rd base side because as the sun sets, it's right in your eyes for a long period of time.  Staff was helpful too.",
      "Rogers Centre is a great place to take in a baseball game. We saw a Sunday 12 noon start and it was a beautiful place to take in a game. We came in from Chicago and Detroit and really enjoyed herself here the club level was a great place to sit. All the amenities were right there where we never had a leave. We were able to eat lunch at a table and step away from our seats. There\u2019s not a bad point of view from anywhere in the stadium!",
      "Went to see the Blue Jays play. Event staff organized, concession stands organized and lines move fast. Got to see the dome open up during a game (see photos). I just wish the fans timed their beer runs better. I missed many pivotal plays because many fans kept blocking my views while they were leaving their seats while players were at bat\u2026..come on guys, get your snacks between innings\u2026!",
      "From an engineering standpoint, this facility is impressive. The concrete looks to be in good shape. The layout is extremely functional. Everything is very easy to find with great wayfinding. Ventilation even with the closed dome is also excellent. However, I do admit it looks and feels very old school (not a bad thing). You don't have the glass exteriors of the new and the overhangs could partially block your view if you get the 200 or 100 seats.  Overall, this is a good time whether you're watching sports, a concert, or something else.",
      "This is one of the most amazing stadium that is always. I enjoyed a lot watching match here, It has super clean seats, friendly and helpful staff  members. Got a lot of food choices here but the main issue is with the price point,the dishes are over priced but as it is a world class stadium so you can't expect food to be cheap. The legroom between the seats is decent enough and the seats are also well maintained here. Overall it's a good experience watching a match here."

      "After a two year hiatus because of the pandemic, The Ex is back! Of course, there is the strike of safety inspectors currently. As a result, out of an abundance of caution, we skipped the rides this year. Well, our five year old daughter is much too young for most of these rides anyway. The prices in the food building are outrageous. With inflation on a high, this was expected going in. We spent $56 on food and, as a group, we feel we didn't eat enough. Shopping wise, many merchants handle contactless payments. Some even accept American Express. Only a few accept cash only. Which is kind of silly as I am completely cashless and wallet-less. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Overall, a fun place to spend the day.",
      "Came on Tuesday during the day til 8pm. Was a normal amount of busy. Not too crazy but exactly what you would expect. We went on around 6 rides. Tips: - 10\u201d mozzarella stick is at Deep Fried in the food building. Beware they may not cook it enough and it will not be melted cheese. - Smash burger at The Gourmet Grill is dry. Has too much bun. - bring water bottle around to fill up at stations - get ride all day pass from someone that works at a corporate company for $20",
      "Going to the CNE each year has been a staple in our family for many many years. I have enjoyed it every single year since I was a child and now my children love it as well. It is the highlight of the summer and was dearly missed during the last two years during the pandemic. This year was absolutely phenomenal with record turnouts and phenomenal food! Highly recommend could not say enough good about it! Love it love it love it!",
      "Overall it was good experience!  The event usually occurs couple of weeks before labour day and ends on Labour day. The place accessible via Public Transport, its right in-front of Exhibition Go station/ Tram station.  There is admission fee for adults and Kids above 5. Event is so colourful with plenty of gameshows and wide variety of food stalls around.There are lots of amusement rides , like giant wheel, rope way, Air Show (time specific)as you move along,  It\u2019s a little pricey at the end but good experience towards end of summer season.",
      "This is definitely the one of must try in Toronto , especially if you want to take out the family. Great place to visit and enjoy the rides and games outside, I personally love the international pavilion where you can absolutely find anything from any country. It\u2019s great for shoppers who seek to find a special gifts and more\u2026"

      "We went to this museum on a weekday and it was still a little busy but still nice. When you\u2019re below 25, you have to register to an annual pass which is free but still takes up a few minutes. The museum in itself was not really my favorite because it had too much of contemporary art which I\u2019m not so fond of. Otherwise, the floor with the miniature boat collection is really nice and the back stairs (accessible from the third and fourth floors) are worth going to admire the view from there. During our visit, there was a nice temporary exhibition which was really nice and intriguing and it seems like they have a nice set of these temp exhibitions !",
      "Where do I even begin?!  I got to the gallery at 3pm, thinking 2.5hrs would be enough time to finish the exhibit. (The gallery closes at 5:30pm)  Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t.  I barely made it through the first floor alone. \ud83d\ude2d will definitely be back though!!  If you can, make a day of it or get the annual pass for an additional $10 (day pass is $25).  In my case, I was only in town for a short visit so didn\u2019t make sense for me to get the annual pass.",
      "A huge 5 level of gallery with amazing arts, models, painting and sculpture by different artists. Every room has a story to tell and one can easily spend an hour just in one section. Make sure to eat well and have ample time with you to visit the gallery. Also, they have a stand where you can keep your coat and bag otherwise if you are carrying a backpack, you have to carry it either on the front or the side but not in the back.  I would recommend to get the tickets online or if you are a member of Toronto Public Library you can avail free passes every Saturday.  Overall, a lovely experience.",
      "Great gallery.  Very pleased at the wide selection of art in the collection, including Canadian art, Indigenous art, and foreign art.  The temporary exhibits are also well done.  It\u2019s also always free for people under 25, which is a great way to get young people involved in the arts!  Tickets should be purchased online in advance even if you are under 25, as you may need to wait for an email confirmation.",
      "I spent approximately four hours in the museum just checking out the ground floor. There were four other levels that I didn't have the time to visit. There's A LOT to see here. It's worth it. Just make sure you have ample time to make the most out of it. There's even a restaurant and a gift shop, so you can pretty much spend most of your day here."

      "I absolutely LOVE Medieval times, I've been there 3 times. Each time, I was lucky enough to try a different meal since I only had vegetarian option in the past, but they have expanded their menu, and cater to special dietary restrictions now. That being said, I don't go for the food, so I can't comment much on it. I love the garlic bread, and the tomato bisque soup is better than any restaurant tomato soup I have ever had!  The show is SPECTACULAR! I will keep going back if I am able to, there's always a new story plot, I love the horses, and knights. Overall, its a wonderful experience! The servers are super nice, friendly, and hardworking, really appreciate the kindness and enthusiasm from everyone at the castle! ",
      "A fun family event. It was well organized and a good pace. The full course dinner was quite good. They had vegetarian and gluten free options too. The portion size could be a bit smaller especially for the kids. They did give a take home bag at the end so that helped. Both adults and kids alike had fun.",
      "It is a wonderful show, far more fun than the expectation.  It takes you back to medieval time and you would feel you were living in hundreds of years ago. The food are also very good especially the medieval soup. I\u2019d suggest to provide half size of the children meal. It is good but too much.",
      "Went there for today's 1:30 show. Absolutely amazing time. My child and I had a blast. So much fun, staff is great, and the atmosphere is really convincing. Clean facilities, lots of open space, and very clean overall. The entertainment was fabulous, and all the actors were amazing at their roles. Will definitely be returning.",
      "A fun time for families & people of ALL AGES. Far more fun than I was expecting, brought me right back to childhood memories. The garlic bread & corn was quite good, entertainment was AMAZING & the actors were great with their roles. Highly recommend this experience for every child & too return as an adult has the same joyful feeling."

      "This is not really a park. There is an inukshuk here and green space. Maybe some seating options if you sit on the rocks. This \"park\" is more of a connection between Coronation Park and Trillium Park. There is also a path to take you to the trail that runs alongside Lake Shore Blvd West.",
      "If you are looking for a park with a playground, this is not the place to go. However, it does have a very large and cool looking Inukshuk for photos. The stones around the Inukshuk are engraved, which provides additional information. I suggest walking the waterfront trail.",

      "If you travel around northern\u00a0#Canada,\u00a0#Alaska, or even\u00a0#Greenland, you may spot large rock formations towering over the landscape, resembling the shape of a person with arms stretching out. They are called\u00a0#Inukshuk.  Inukshuk,\u00a0a structure made of stones piled on top of each other, was\u00a0used for navigation in the frozen north where, in the snow of Tundra, everything could look the same.\u00a0\u00a0Peoples of the\u00a0#Arctic use them to mark\u00a0hunting grounds for\u00a0#caribou,\u00a0#seal,\u00a0#walrus,\u00a0#whale\u00a0or landing sites for boats and\u00a0kayaks\u00a0or\u00a0to warn travellers of dangerous currents beneath the ice.  #Inuksuit\u00a0are also sacred to the #native peoples.\u00a0Many #Inuit retain strong attachments to inuksuit believed to have been built by their ancestors. Evidence shows this\u00a0tradition is as old as 9000 years.\u00a0 And, some of these landmarks have been standing for 2000 years.  Traditionally constructed by the\u00a0Inuit, Inuksuit are often intertwined with representations of Canada and\u00a0#theNorth.  #Indigenous\u00a0#NativeAmerican\u00a0#I\u00f1upiat,\u00a0#Kalaallit,\u00a0#Yupik,\u00a0\u00a0#NorthernCanada,\u00a0#Greenland,\u00a0#Alaska\u00a0#Inunnguaq\u00a0#Tundra"

The 350-foot-long (110 m) structure serves as the eastern gateway to the Canadian National Exhibition, an annual agricultural and provincial fair held at Exhibition Place.",

You can play, walk, sit and relax, picnic with friends and family. It offers the shade of beautiful old trees and soft grass below your feet. Enjoy the best of nature close to home.",
      "Very interesting history of this park, apparently it's on the reclaimed land when the workers didn't have had any work.. Trees are also planted by veteran's and it has memorials too.. a good place and a good combination of lake front, baseball ground, cycle tracks and so on.",

This location has multiple screens for large showings (250 or so) to some smaller theatres that seat 20 viewers.  The staff and volunteers here are very friendly and always look forward to the big September festival that brings a worldwide cast of talent to showcase their goods for all to enjoy",
      "Excellent seating arrangement and ambiance. The sound is amazing, I felt the screen size is a bit smaller compared to the regular Cineplex though . Excellent location at the heart of Toronto's Entertainment District.",
      "The theatre is amazing and has a very nice viewing podium. Therefore even if you are in the front the movie doesn't look so close. The movie selections are really good as movies which don't get released elsewhere are present here. Members also get to watch movies for free too and the price of a ticket is also very affordable as well. Definitely make a trip to watch international acclaim movies without fail.",
      "First time in and loved the ambience and the screening rooms. Quite spacious and friendly ushers to direct you as needed even if it's just getting to the restroom. Not privileged enough to get into the lounge so had to settle for the smaller cafeteria experience. Gift shop offered many TIFF assortment of purchase options and very informative staff. Very clean, well maintained."

Great area to walk around around and check out the little shops and restaurants.  Different types of foods for everyone.  The murals were great to see. We were glad to have found the area.  If you're visiting Toronto, this should be a destination spot to walk around and eat.",

The only downside is that it is not too clean.",

I dint got much time to explore the whole park but you can still find good decent place to hang around with friends and enjoy your weekend with peace. Dogs are allowed and be careful if you don't like them bcoz there will be always around with owners. A good picnic stop within the town. Parking is paid on streets and if you take a trnaist do not take form Ossinigton since it's crowded on weekends and frequent is very bad. You may need to walk to nearest station that is whatbi did Fter waiting for a bus for almost 1/2hr"

      "Nice little park in downtown Toronto. 30% of the park is an enclosed dog park. Very popular with dogs. On a warm sunny afternoon, its great to sit on the bench near the central water fountain and people watch. Many people grab a beer or two from the next door LCBO and chat with friends after work. The grass is not well kept, but is acceptable. There are often sketchy homeless people drinking in this park, but they are pretty harmless.",
      "My dog hates it here. It\u2019s probably the ice cold people and poorly socialised dogs. But hey, it\u2019s a leash free dog park, so that\u2019s something."

A fountain with a large play area, a chess board table, many benches and an interesting sculpture dedicated to a local community member who had helped the people in the area in many ways.

      "I go there maybe once a year for a game. It is the only place to see baseball. The main (bad) thing is getting there. There is a very long 15 minutes walk from Union subway. And if you don't exit the same gate that leads you back to Union subway station you can be out onto Bathurst street. The street at the exits are not clearly marked, for night time. And if you drive, the parking is $25+, and the traffic is so bad around there. The seats are so small and levels are extremely steep. There is much garbage under people's seat. The food is extremely pricey. I guess it is normal. I don't normally buy much except water ($5,6).",
      "Event rate is outrageous, absolutely no need to charge so much money to have someone Park their car. Especially in a place where the lanes are barely wide enough for one car let alone two. As well, there is construction so they have closed off many parts of the different levels, yet continue to charge the outrageous $35 price to park there. Other than being convenient to get to the jays game, this is a rip off, you should find somewhere else to park, even if the daily rate is reasonable just based on principle alone.",
      "Nice place but there was a kind of annoying baseball game on.",
      "Traffic is absolutely insane after anything held here, to make it worse the people who drive dont deserve their license these losers act like they're isnt a traffic rule cause cops aren't around, make it incredibly hard for anyone to get out, police escorts that watch as lane cut offs allow ppl to ruin traffic. It was the worst driving experience ever.",
      "Same old thing Lack of security of  line jumpers outside gate 5 and all othe gates. They all go inside 15 before the gates open to work inside. They need more guards . Don't need to loose yourself before a expensive game ."

      "Not much to see here in comparison to other museums like Mackenzie House",
      "It's a historical house yes, but most of the house is actually office space or an escape room game. There are two rooms downstairs, a rendition of George Brown's office/library and the dining room. It was not really what I expected when visiting the house. I expected more of a museum feel to it.",
      "The George Brown House was absolutely perfect for the wedding ceremony, giving us a beautifully decorated and cost friendly intimate space that still let us have our dream Victorian-themed wedding. The venue managers were very professional, quick to reply, and worked closely with us almost on a weekly basis to answer our hundreds of questions and ensure that our day would go as we planned. Being a national heritage venue does mean that there are several restrictions (e.g. limited candle usage, no confetti/rice, etc.), but these were things we could easily negotiate solutions to. Even on the day of, venue staff worked hand in hand with our wedding party to ensure a smooth rundown.",

      "Very nice park! One of the best free park that I have ever seen. Especially during cherry blossom season! People is packed during weekends so better go during weekdays to appreciate the nature and peacefulness of the place. It does not feel that it was situated inside a city. Finding a place to park your car near the park is kinda difficult, we have to park near the lake and walk which is okay since the weather is good. We will definitely go back! You also have to walk to find restaurants",
      "It may be the best park in Toronto! It's suitable for hiking or walking dogs in summer, and there are many facilities and trails to choose from. There are a zoo, nature trails, and a dog walks area, a swimming pool, a tennis court, playgrounds, and many trees! There are a lot of parking spaces here and many shared bicycles to rent. It is also convenient to have a subway station next to the park. We visited this park for the first time and had a great afternoon here.",
      "High park is my favourite part of Toronto especially when you want surround yourself with nature without getting out Toronto. Fall is so stunning here. There are lots of small trains for a easy hike in the park. And btw, this park is huge, with a beautiful lake with swans and ducks. Must visit if you are a tourist, or looking to go for a trail run or just to spend some peaceful time in nature. Heads-up: weekend can be busy, especially in summers and everyone is here taking lots of pictures.",
      "It\u2019s beautiful. Very nice place to hangout with friends, family or alone if you like. You can see various types of bird, goose, swans. On top you will find parking, washroom, food place for convenience (not sure if they are open around the year). Rent a bicycle or walk around to see beautiful nature. Only issue I would say it\u2019s busy sometime",
      "It's a huge park, very beautiful and great for a lot of activities. Parking inside is closed during weekends, nearby street parking is usually full and finding a spot becomes bit of a hassle sometimes and has 3 hours limit. But once you get inside, it's great for spending time with family in a beautiful natrual serene environment. Great for a walk, cycling, picnic with friends and family, there's also a free zoo where kids enjoy watching and interacting with the animals. It's specially beautiful during the cherry blossom season and offers great spots for taking beautiful pictures. The play area is also great for kids of all ages. Overall it's one of the best parks in the city!"

It can also get blown around causing a breathing hazard. The location of this park is between two highways and next to a train track, the air quality is terrible for kids. The dirt pumptrack is non-functional. The woodent pump track is a great feature for all ages to learn on. No bathrooms. Has a drinking fountain."

Dog friendly place to socialize with nice grass to play, secluded shady areas available. Clean washrooms and the splashpad is so cool on a hot day. Love the train that pulls by every so often adding to ambience of Toronto. Quiet spot among the noise.",

The current exhibit has some painting, photography, and sculpture but also includes works which utilize mixed media and interactivity. The museum occupies several floors and I recommend taking the stairs if you can.  There's a restaurant on the main floor but there is also a brewery and a coffee roastery nearby.",

At the moment, there typically is only 3 floors and less than 5 exhibits/artists being featured, but its always awesome and thought provoking works of art! Every first Sunday of the month is free, sponsored by TD, so consider coming on one of those days.  MOCA has come a long way from their small gallery space on Queen West years ago, so we need to celebrate what they have been able to offer and make use of this beautiful space \u2764\ufe0f",

One thing to note before going to the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto is to review their website for the particular exhibition or display that is going on in the week you want to visit else you will be surprised by what you see compared to the art posted by reviewers. For example, during the day I visited, it was the exhibition of THOMAS DEMAND HOUSE OF CARD & MARTIN BOYCE, RIRKRIT TIRAVANIA, CARUSO STJOHN , and this is to run through December 2022. And so if you visit in February, you may not see any of these things."

I just like to sit on a banch and watching people,childrens,dogs and all the activities, the residents of this neighborhood participate a lot of the life of this park by organizing family activities, in the summer there are films screening and once a week a public market and without forgetting you people who playing tennis, baseball, running.... For myself the pumpkin ball in October is the most grandiose. Love this park \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a",
      "Sorauren is a gem of a park. Great place to have a picnic or play some games in the summer. There is a decent sized dog park that is accesible all year. In the spring/summer/fall there is a farmers market ever Monday night.  A new community centre that will be located at the southeast cornber of the park is currently  in the design phase. It will maintain most of the current amenities but add gym and pool spaces among others.",
      "Has a great cafe right by the park, everyone seems to come for the soft serve, I enjoyed the chia pudding which was an option for people who don't consume sugar. I got to enjoy myself while my son was at a birthday party at the park, lots of room to run around. Very family oriented, although coming to the cafe is not the best place to study as it is a busy place, at least it was on a Sunday. Overall pleasant experience, thank you."

      "A hidden gem! We were out for a family drive and just happened to turn into this place that we have always just drove past.  Good thing we did! It's an outdoor and indoor historic village, buildings from the late 1880s onwards.  They have building tours; the place is connected to walking trails; and inside the interpretive centre was a free art installation... An interactive one at that!  Washroom facilities are brand new and clean. Outside, there were brand new info plaques that even had a few audio nuggets to drop... Very cool! It's someplace that we will drop by once or twice a year to see what new installations they have on, and catch a tour!",

They were very well preserved and have very cool artefacts/replicas, such as antique cash, TTC transfers, and what bathtubs (if you could call it so) used to look like. The grounds are also quite nice for a walk; you could take a short loop around the museum. I even spotted a blue heron! Would encourage more people to come and visit. Plus, you could walk from here to/from Evergreen Brick Works to make it a longer outing."

      "A great place to enjoy nature as it is. The walking trail is natural with multiple humanmade wooden bridges over water bodies. You can walk up to the top to have a better view of the entire place. Great place to go alone, with friend or family. They don't have toilets everywhere so make sure to visit one at the building one before going in or after coming out. The bus stops right at the parking lot. They also have a cafe at the entrance building but they close up by 5 pm. The sound of the leaves when the wind goes through then is what I found most amazing about this place. The place is quiet even though there were a lot of people with kids and pets.",
      "Lots of trails to enjoy a quick hike.. still so close to the city but feels like you're in a forest. The views of the city are also fantastic from here. We always bike here and find it quite challenging to dock our bike share bikes. It's great that there's bike path all the way here. There's always a farmer's market or vintage clothes going on here. So it's super vibrant but pretty expensive. We love it and visit in all seasons except in winter of course. Fall and spring are particularly beautiful.",
      "I recently visited this place for the first time and loved it! What an awesome way to keep the history alive while breathing in life into it. I plan on coming back during their Saturday market but the Sunday I went was beautiful. It was a great day to go walking on their paths, reading about the history and learning about the wildlife. There needs to be more places like this that help us reconnect to nature.",
      "Well maintained paved trails at the top and bottom level with nature all around! Going up to the top starting from the right side (or left, it's a loop) gives a great view of the hills and the city skyline. Once you reach the Don Valley Parks lookout, there's a small dirt path that takes you to the railway tracks. The path also connects to the Beltline trail.  There is a small shop containing lots of knickknacks and potential souvenirs at the main entrance area. The cafe is also a lovely place to get refreshments or a meal. Plenty of seats and picnic tables around as well, although it does get crowded during popular times in autumn.",
      "One of Toronto\u2019s true gems, this urban oasis has it all. Great walking paths, tons of wildlife and a real sense of nature in the middle of our city. On a daily basis in the spring and summer you\u2019ll see turtles, frogs, snakes and a plethora of birds.  Originally where most of the bricks in Toronto came from this amazing place has been transformed.  The farmers market in the summer months is a huge bonus. From fresh strawberries to delicious street food and if you\u2019re lucky a live music performance I highly recommend a trip to the Brick works."

      "I love coming to this park and i am so glad it's just a 20 min walk away from home. The place is very well maintained, there are beautiful trees all over, play ground for kids, a big wide open field for kids to run around, or for people to chill. There a pretty big dog area as well, for all the dog owners and dog lovers to come around. I personally love to come here on days off just to look at dogs interacting. This park gives me a sense of peace, everyone seems to enjoy their time here. One of the best community parks in East York area. Definetly worth a visit, especially now with all the foliage.",
      "I love this market so much, not in my neighborhood but it's worth making the trip out there on Saturdays in the spring, summer and fall.  They use reusable programs like Muuse.ca too\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0e",

      "a very beautiful place, and so much history, with some gravestones from mid 19th century, along with very new ones. I love going there, very peaceful and meditative space (even with the noisy DVP so close). I only wish there were more benches. there is also the splendid chapel by the main entrance, which is so photogenic. by TTC: probably the best way to get there is 506 streetcar (get off at Parliament/Carlton) or 65 Parliament bus (get off at Parliament/Winchester - it is about 5-10 minutes walk east - giving you an opportunity to admire the charming and quiet Cabbagetown streets. l",

You can catch rabbits and deer along this trail that runs parallel to the Don River. It is mostly wooded with patches of grass space and some seating along the riverbed. Repaving is overdue on many points along the trail, particularly near Riverdale Park.",

Endless areas to walk, bike, even mountain bikes in the area. Great for families, children and furry kids. Trails are plenty wide enough to social distance and really not that many people can be seen as the trails are off in many different directions. You can travel north or south, towards the Brick Works or away from that area. You can cross the Don River over a foot pedestrian bridge and or walk along the small water side trails."

There are washrooms and water fountains onsite and I think a small cafe but it would be smart to bring your own snacks or a meal.  Free parking on the south side of the farm.

      "A must see for a quick weekend hike. Photoes are from my hike last spring. Lots pf greens and beautiful sceneries to take pictures. There's also a beatuiful pond with green leaves on top.",
      "Beautiful park, well kept. People who use this park seem responsible and clean after themselves. I never find garbage or dog feces anywhere on the ground. Please don't ruin it. Thank you",
      "We had a birthday party at this park. It was great. Lots of space for picnicking, playing soccer, trees for climbing\ud83d\ude01, natural life ponds, hiking, cool place. There is paid parking or if you lucky you can get free parking on the road near the upper level of the park."

      "You get a beautiful landscaoe view from this point...lovely scenery and nice neighbourhood walk while reaching this place. Good to visit during evening to enjoy amazing sunset view. I visited during morning and weather was cold...but a good spot around.",
      "Decent lookout spot. It is a bit far back from the city, so you may need a decent camera to get a good shot. Can get busy enough, especially around dusk as a lot of people come for sunset. There is a house beside it that does seem to, understandably, get frustrated when people encroach on the property. We saw a couple park outside their garage and were asked to move. This lookout is in a residential area so I'd just say, be respectful of the residents and their neighbourhood.",
      "Amazing views! You can just relax or hangout at this place. But the view can be better if they trim down some trees which obstruct the view of the skyline.",
      "Sweet little spot. It was cold when we went there but would love to go during a lively weather and just lounge around. The sunsets  be amazing. Pretty Toronto skyline on the spot.",
      "Such a calm barely crowded place with a lovely view. Located at the end of a residential lane. We went around 6pm on friday but very less people. However not even a bench so not the place to hang out as a group and also the area is tiny. Can park on the lane."

      "I give the park and the Lower Don River Trail 4 star for it's natural beauty and the way it's kept untouched at the heart of the city. But I got one star back because there are no seats or any washroom facility along the trail (unless we get further off the trail).  I understand that we don't want to disrupt the natural environment by construction, though, at least seats along the trail at safe places and environmentally-friendly structures and washrooms do help to attract more people and the ones who can't walk long trails without getting rest along the way on seats.  This good trail also needs more access by providing more entry paths to the park from all neighbourhoods around the area.",
      "Great place to take your kids to ride.  It is paved trails and it is very flat.  I can't believe we saw deers too.",
      "Perfect place for a Park with so much foot traffic and or bikes traveling the trails of the Don River. Just needs some picnic tables for the summer months. We made our way from Riverdale Park West today and hiked along the Don River up as far as Pottery Road and so much has changed over the years. I miss that wooden structure that we used to walk or bike on that passed under the bridges. Now the trail takes you away from the 2 bridges and no sign of the past.",
      "The bike trail from Canary District is a great cycling workout along the River. Many cyclists along the way. The trail is located within the city, and in the summer, it gives you a feeling of riding in the villages of India. Didn\u2019t see any wildlife other than the insects that fly into your mouth and nose while cycling. Try to get done with the trail way before sunset to avoid the insects.",

      "Pretty good. The park is pretty small but well maintained. Probably not suitable for older people - you need to go up the hill quite a bit. The parking is plentiful at $8/day but it gets busy on the weekends.",
      "This is one of my favourite parks in the city! I first went there many years ago before the buildings were restored as part of a field trip. I learned about the wonderful geological features, like fossils of trilobites and even a giant beaver! However, the beautiful wetlands were what captured my heart. It\u2019s so amazing to see wildlife like snapping turtles and blue herons in the city! I highly recommend hiking up to the lookout, especially in autumn to take in all the glorious colours.",

The roads are uphill, downhill and turned all the way to loops, you\u2019ll get confuse, I think that\u2019s the idea so you don\u2019t wander around here.

Quality seems universally high and prices are reasonable for such an  entertaining atmosphere. There's lots of green space, many TTC options, plentiful parking, and that stretch of St. Clair provides a variety of interesting shopping opportunities. Highly recommended!",

      "This was a great experience... very cool castle estate. Gardens were cool. Historical write-ups for the rooms, a horse stable, antique car museum, and a Back Stage Celebrities walk, which has little scenes with (wax?) statues and clips playing for all of the movies that were recorded at the castle. Loved it! I wasn't quite as excited about the 3rd floor, but if you are into military history, you would love it. Getting up to the tower was awesome, too.",
      "Truly a beautiful space! It's a Gothic Revival style mansion and house museum with beautiful grounds during the summer. I can imagine weddings at this place! To get to the highest levels you have to take some very narrow stairs and if you are able to, it's totally worth going to the top. You will see amazing views of the surrounding areas! Can't wait to return here someday when things are back to normal, or as close to normal as possible!",
      "The place was amazing. Last time that I was in here was when I was a child. Everything changed a lot! The guy at the front collecting tickets was super nice! And answered all our questions.  Our favorite was getting to climb the stairs all the way to the top floor! We wish the secret garden was open. I heard lots of good things about it. We also loved the celebrity rooms.  It keeps on running through my mind on what if Casa loma did an overnight thing where they turn off all the lights and everyone used a flashlight. That will be amazing. Maybe do this for Halloween?  We will be back for sure!",
      "When visiting Toronto don\u2019t miss the opportunity to visit this beautiful castle. The grounds and fountains and gardens are beautiful. So much elegance and history is packed in each room. This castle was really interesting and fun to explore. There are plenty of places to relax and just take in the views. It\u2019s like a museum but more engaging and fun. Apparently they have a Halloween show but my visit was before then. I bet this place looks fabulous decked out for Christmas .",
      "More than the castle and its architecture, I enjoyed the history of the castle presented in a documentary movie in the basement. So, be sure to check that out which is included in your ticket. Another perk is that you get audio guide devices which were very cool. The ones that we got did not have headphones so you had to hold them like you are speaking on the phone, but I saw some other people with devices having headphones. The most enjoyable part of the experience was that there are 2 towers that you had to climb very narrow stairs to reach the top. They were decorated and designed for escape room game purposes which was fun to see. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience."

I loved the geology part. You can find brilliant minerals and stones. It is one of the best museum I have ever seen. Highly recommended to visit.",
      "The ROM is World Class, all the way! Better then any of the Smithsonian in Washington DC. It is really a natural history and art & culture museum rolled into one! I only spent a few hours here, however you could come here for days and still be able to take in everything. I would recommend visiting the museum website in advance and prioritize what collections you want to see. Some rooms are going to be more busy then others based on the content. Lots of child friendly exhibits, ask the curators as to which ones are best suited for children. I bought the city pass in advance. NOTE: For the city pass the museum does require you to pick a day of visitation in advance. The city pass made it easy to access the museum. I recommend a visit to the geology collection. Some of the biggest geodes I have ever seen!",
      "Clean and organized. Big and spacious museum. The dinosaur floor is a win for the kids and the most packed. In other floors/exhibits, Not so much of the Displays are so archaic but still worth a visit.. The artist's exhibition is also a nice one, they help in introducing promising artists. We enjoyed our visit. We enjoyed it. There\u2019s so many things to see at the ROM. We had less than 2 hours before closing, and wish we had more time. Each floor is full of amazing artifacts! Very informative, quick lines to get in, and worth visiting - especially with the CITY PASS. We will be back!",
      "ROM has an amazing collection. Every section you go seems better than the previous. Even if you have specific interests you can't help but appreciate others. If one wants to take a glimpse at every exhibit it can easily take 3 hours to complete the museum. But if one really wants to examine and learn they can spend the whole day in one section",
      "A day well spent at the ROM, from the Dinosaurs display to the Bats cave, from learning about the ancient to modern history of the World. The museum is large with pretty nice interiors and well-displayed artifacts; my favourites were the Minerals and Precious stones section. The staff was also polite and helpful. One thing I would suggest is that they should increase the closing time from 5:30 to 7 PM. Overall it's a nice place to spend the day."

      "One of the more impressive communities here; deep roots in the social gospel, good to see those judged by society freely accepted here, acceptance and open discussion about the world is very important and I don't feel stifled here. After being mistreated at conservative places, this place is one of the few faith communities in which actions speak louder then empty words. As church attendance falls from churches, it rests on progressive churches to show the way in accepting millenials instead of scoffing at them. As Tolstoy says, if you have rightly become alienated by organized religion and their hate and hypocrisy, don't let it scare you away from your mission to help other people, seek God/Nature again, and don't let men and their evils rule you, otherwise they will win.",

      "I don't know what this is like as a church, but it's a great concert hall. Acoustics were lovely, and it was well-organized and pretty easy to get to, even for those of us outside of Toronto. We parked at the Green P garage at 20 Delisle, and that worked great.",
      "On Wednesdays after 5pm they offer a hot meal service during beginning of winter on November til March next year. A variety of tasty soups plus an option of veggie or meat dinner and dessert. They also provide a ttc token per person and clothing bank.",
      "One of the the oldest Baptist church in Toronto. It's beautiful stone walls and it's high cathedral like ceilings make this church an awesome sight to see. The people are really friendly and polite! They validate parking on Sundays. I'm so glad me and my bible study group came here New Years eve!",
      "Beautiful church, huge, accommodates 500 easily.   Christmas Concert with Lorena Mckennit was wonderful.",
      "They play their bells randomly and for hours at a time it\u2019s 2pm on a Thursday and the bell has been going for an hour. Not a song or anything just donging. This happens often and also at random so you can\u2019t plan your work calls around the noise. I once made the mistake of emailing and asking if their was a schedule for the bells so I could plan around them and got a rude reply saying \u201cThe bells ring every 15 minutes.\u201d (they do not, sometimes they play every 15 but usually every hour sometimes *for* 3hours) I\u2019m not even asking them to stop! Just to post a schedule or something so people can work around them"

      "I was able to visit this place as a part of Doors Open Toronto. The house is fantastic - they've done a wonderful job maintaining the historical finishes inside - to match the photos that exist.  There was staff in every room, explaining details about the house. They had a video playing in the basement that went into even more detail.  The grounds are even more stunning. They had little games like they would have been playing in the 1800s. The trees were flowering(!!!), the gardens were perfect... It was breathtaking.",
      "I really liked this museum. Excellent preservation of the home with very knowledgeable guides to take you on a tour of each room. There\u2019s also the beautiful, really well-maintained grounds where you can grab a drink, do some reading or just sit and soak in the peace and quiet.  Highly recommend a visit, especially on a nice summer day.",

The temple is well kept and the idols are dressed very beautifully with colourful attires. There is place to take off and keep your shoes. Then, one can sanitize their hands with the available sanitizer before entering the temple. This temple is not crowded at all. I have been on Sundays and there used be hardly one or two other people.",
      "One of the best place in toronto to experience peace of mind and blissfulness. One must visit this temple to get the blessings of Deities.Hare Krishna temple is very well kept and organized in all manners. Atmosphere inside is truly energetic and divine. The volunteers here are so supportive and when we talk to them we ourself feel energetic and happy. The Temple also serves food here by name of Govinda which is very fresh and satvik as well. On Krishna Janmashtami the temple is crowded as people from all over toronto visit here for blessings. Highly recommended.Hare Krishna!",

      "A great place to spend your Sunday if you're into Zen meditation",
      "Very warm and welcoming place. Not yet a full member but have found the Sunday services (both at 10:00 and 4:00; the latter is best for beginners) straightforward, helpful and well-organised. There's no pressure and you can meditate however you'd like, but they also offer training programmes for Korean Son (Zen/Chan) sitting practice. By far the best place to begin with this in Toronto, with plenty of events to encourage participation.",
      "I am not sure how to accurately convey my experience here with a simple review. But hopefully, someone will hear what they need to hear in reading what I write here.  I started here in 2011, coming my first time simply to learn how to meditate.  I had no intention of getting into Buddhism, as the idea seemed foreign to me, and to be honest I was/am skeptical of religions as a whole to begin with. But meditation is a thing that has nothing to do with religions. So, for certain reasons that I won't get into, I wanted to learn. Or shall I say rather, that I felt obligated to learn. Wanting had really nothing to do with it...  ...at first.  I came once a week to meditate, and slowly at first, I became exposed to little things about Buddhism here and there. Quite honestly, I was expecting the hard sell, or at least a soft one from the Sunim (monk), and the Abbess. But what I got was neither. What I got were things that no matter how much I tried, and threw all of my experience and knowledge (and this was considerable, I believe) against I could not find any fault with. So this was enough to open the door wider for me to get a bigger step inside. The rest (as far as my story goes) is history.  Buddhism (of the Korean Zen variety, as is the tradition here) gave me the tools to change my life from that of an abused and neglected child who grew up angry, disfunctional, emotionally scarred, traumatized, and - my major problem at the time, for which I was desperately seeking a solution to - ADDICTED TO FENTANYL (as well as just about everything else), to that of one who is at peace, and who sees the world completely different than I used to. Not so terribly deluded as I was, able to help others, able to find joy in my connection with others, and with all living beings. Able to be fully compassionate, fully empathetic, fully loving as an individual. I have this place to thank for all of that.  I'd been to AA, NA, CA, rehab (8 times), detox (15 times), committed (twice), arrested (once, charged but not convicted), Kundalini Yoga for addiction program ($3000), retreats ( too many), seminars (too many), and odd ball programs here and there. Not saying that it all didn't work. It's all part of my story, and every bit of it has contributed to my betterment in some way or another. But any truth to be found in all of the aforementioned, is truth that the Buddha dharma is about specifically, almost as though all of these programs were attempts to convey a truth that Buddhism states without any cloud cover, or misunderstanding.  I would not suggest simply showing up will solve all your problems in life, but you may just find what your looking for.  If you come, you will be most welcome. Who knows, maybe even by me, lol.",
      "I love this place. Sanha is very inspiring, she leads the meditation with pure presence and embodies all the qualities I am trying to develop with my meditation practice.",
      "Great place to be. Very friendly sangha. Regular meditation classes offered for all levels."

If you appreciate decorative ceramics and glass, then this is a must see!",

Staff - Friendly and knowledgeable, they have amazing people working at the museum.  Services - They do classes on clay pottery, so be sure to check it out. Also, it is free currently in 2022 Aug. Which is an amazing way to give back  to the community.  Highly recommend if you love pottery, ceramics, and art in general. \ud83d\udc4d",

      "These games are really well done, and designed to work well with larger groups that could be strangers. There are lots of puzzles to keep big groups all active and entertained. Also means you can go more than once to each, and do different parts. For experienced escape artists, the puzzles are a bit on the easier side, but still quite fun and engaging. The staff actors are also fun, and aren't part of most experiences elsewhere. Great for hooking your friends before taking them to private rooms.",
      "We Loved it, we try to go every year! It's so much fun! If you  can't do stairs then  think twice as there are many stairs in the courtyard.",
      "I've done at least 8 escape rooms this year and Escape Casa Loma-- at least, the escape room itself-- definitely makes my top 3.  Pros: The live actors really made the experience unique and immersive. They were all decked out in clothes fitting with the theme. They were always in character and had great, infectious energy. The escape room itself was fun and full of interesting puzzles, and no two were the same, despite there being so many. There were few to no literal locks that you had to find a combination for; everything as far as I could remember was sensor-based, which is extremely creative. I loved that there were multiple floors leading up to a tower-- but after a while we got a bit sick of the stairs. The decor was beautiful and I loved every detail.  Cons: The stairs were endless, and I really wish the website were more upfront about how many stairs you'd need to climb -- not only within the escape room itself, but also just to get there. It's also kind of unclear where to go to get to the escape room and you have to walk through a lot of employee hallways, which was very off-putting. I also think mixed group escape rooms shouldn't exist, since it ruins the experience greatly, and feels like a cash grab. Luckily, we got a nice group of people, but it was still slightly awkward and felt jarring when trying to solve puzzles in a timely manner.  Overall, a top-tier escape room with a few flaws that strongly impacted the experience, but still one of my favorites by far. I'd definitely go back to Toronto just to do another escape room here, but I'd try to get a full group if possible to avoid another mixed one.",
      "Such a fun, immersive escape room experience! The actors stay in character and give clues which really keeps the atmosphere. Some of the challenges are tough and require thinking outside the box but we got it right down to the last minute which made it very exciting! Will go back for sure. We did the King of the Bootleggers.",
      "My Bachelorette party and I had a lot of fun at the Casa Loma Escape room! The interactive hosts are really good actors and help with subtle hints when you get stuck. We just missed escaping, but that's okay. They walked us through what we missed and I will most likely be trying another one of their Escape rooms in the future."

The theme was creepy and atmospheric, the actors were very good and scared us at times, and the puzzles were unique, challenging, and fun to do!

On nice days, the park will be full of people given the amenities: Ping pong/table tennis table Baseball diamond Tennis court Children's playground with swings and climbing structure Small splash pad Small garden Free book exchange Public washrooms  There's also a public bike rental in this park.",
      "The park is medium in size. Popular among local people. Baseball area in one corner. Ice cream truck in another corner. Good for picnic and spending good time with your family and friends.",
      "As someone who has relocated from Dubai which has fantastic parks, I was pleasantly surprised with the number of parks in Toronto. Oriole park near davisville subway station is a fantastic clean park for kids. My daughter loved open space, greenery and the water splash area where kids love to cool down. It also has couple of tennis courts and a very unique table tennis table and lots of space for jogging.",
      "Such a good vibe park. Everyone has something for them here. Table Tennis and Tennis court adds extra attractions. Toddler water splash area is a huge hit too. Colorful, pretty park",
      "Clean and well maintained park. Not huge, but certainly worth a stroll through.  There's a baseball diamond, a playground, benches, and a ping pong table (paddles and balls not provided, of course).  On the weekends it gets fairly busy, and during the warmer seasons, there are often peewee baseball games (which can get loud, be mindful of this if you're seeking serenity).  This park connects to bicycle routes in all cardinal directions, including the beltline trail."

Plus since it\u2019s right next to the mall we were able to get drinks and use the washroom without any issues through the day (since we didn\u2019t want to use the opera potties). Thanks for hosting a wonderful event and hope to attend next year.",

Some stuff is starting to look dated and it's not great when it's muddy, but it's got charm. Good sledding Hill for smaller kids. It's been ages but have fond memories of visiting the farmers market, but I live too far to come for weekday markets. Today I discovered they have a city run fire pit too.",

The current exhibit has some painting, photography, and sculpture but also includes works which utilize mixed media and interactivity. The museum occupies several floors and I recommend taking the stairs if you can.  There's a restaurant on the main floor but there is also a brewery and a coffee roastery nearby.",

At the moment, there typically is only 3 floors and less than 5 exhibits/artists being featured, but its always awesome and thought provoking works of art! Every first Sunday of the month is free, sponsored by TD, so consider coming on one of those days.  MOCA has come a long way from their small gallery space on Queen West years ago, so we need to celebrate what they have been able to offer and make use of this beautiful space \u2764\ufe0f",

One thing to note before going to the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto is to review their website for the particular exhibition or display that is going on in the week you want to visit else you will be surprised by what you see compared to the art posted by reviewers. For example, during the day I visited, it was the exhibition of THOMAS DEMAND HOUSE OF CARD & MARTIN BOYCE, RIRKRIT TIRAVANIA, CARUSO STJOHN , and this is to run through December 2022. And so if you visit in February, you may not see any of these things."

      "Beautiful little park encapsulated by Ivy growing up the tall fences. Lots of places to sit, nice playground/swings for the kids, water dispensers for a dog dish and one for a water bottle. It's nice to see a park with so much thought put into it for a change"

      "Great park with plenty of picnic benches. A lawn bowling club and a park for the kids. If I'm not mistaken I believe there is a dog park as well. Lots to do in such small park. Great place for hanging out",
      "We've been taking our dog here since he was about 4 months old. Great off-leash park for younger dogs, enough room for them to run around while still being able to keep an eye on them. There's a fountain right outside the gate for when your thirsty pup needs a water refill.",
      "One of the best neighbourhood dog parks.  Fun for both doggos and their humans. Plenty of shade for those hot summer days.",
      "Great little park with splash pad, ping pong table, dog kennel, lawn bowling court, washrooms, playground.",
      "Nestled on a residential area right next to Keele Street, this great little local park comes complete with an off leash area for dogs, a fenced in playground area for children, and a lawn bowling club, as well as enough grass to set up a picnic if you so choose.  It's also got some picnic benches, park benches, and some Muskoka chairs for relaxing in."

      "I love relaxing in this park. Beautiful community vines. All that's missing is drop in baseball games!",

      "It is a great park. They have got new monkey bars and kind playground. It is a lot of fun for everybody. And course, sledding in the Winter is the best!",
      "Decent park for kids to play in, with a splash pad and other playground equipment. Upper baseball diamond area might be better used as a dog park since we rarely see a game on, but always see people playing there with their dogs",
      "Great for walking with my pup when High Park is too busy as the neighbourhood is pleasant to stroll through (mostly dog - friendly).  In winter, a coyote might live in the hidden zone/ small northern ravine). We have only seen them once in 3 years, but others see one seasonally.  If you head North on Parkside, there is a small off-leash on the East side."

      "\"The Junction\" is name which originally came from the fact that The West Toronto Diamond, a junction of four railway lines. Historically The Junction was a manufacturing community that underwent a lot of development in the late 1800s. As in many railway and factory towns, pubs became a mainstay of the community and the drinking of the workers got so out of control that the sale of alcohol was banned in the Junction from for over 90 years.Even after The Junction was Annexed by Toronto, prohibition continued. As a result, it's no wonder this area struggled to attract businesses for a number of years."
