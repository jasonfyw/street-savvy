The patio is nice, but I personally enjoy sitting inside - it's like being invited over to eat at a family friend's house than being at a restaurant. Service is friendly, personal and absolutely delightful. Food is fairly priced and generously portioned. I recommend the Jamaica and Horchatta drinks for something light and refreshing. There's nothing negative I can say about my experience here!!",

Luckily I had cousins coming in Toronto and wanted to go to Lee's to celebrate their birthday.\n\nLet me tell you, beginning to end, we were not deceived AT ALL. The quality of service is incredibly amazing, something that I was expecting from this restaurant but they went over my expectations. You don't even notice when their refreshing your plates or refilling your water. We had such an astounding waiter, Conor, he was more than a perfect host. We are glad that we had him serving us. He knew the menu detailed to the bone.\n\nWe were a group of 5 and chose to do the \"Chef's Choice\", I believe that's what its called... We give them a price and they are able to choose your menu. More like a surprise 3 course menu concept. We had so much food that we were all so full at the end that we were scared we wouldn't have any space for dessert. Such a great experience.",

                "text": "We came here after hearing great things about the restaurant. To our excitement this restaurant did not disappoint, everything we had was delicious and I had zero complaints. It's best if you share your food here as opposed to individually getting your own meals, as you can try more dishes. I was skeptical about the Singapore style slaw at first as I'm not a fan of regular slaw but it was amazing! It was fresh and full of flavours, 20 ingredients to be exact. The reviews recommended the cheeseburger spring rolls so we got them and they were definitely worth it as well. I recommend getting the goat cheese tart if you're a fan of olives, cheese and philo pastry because it was delicious as well. The Top Chef curry roasted chicken is a must have, each bite had loads of flavour if you ate it with all the sauces and pineapple too. The servers were very knowledgeable about the food and provided great customer service also. We didn't get the signature sangria so I can't speak to that, but the table beside us did and was complimenting it. I was surprised at the quality in the food because for the same price in many upscale restaurants in Toronto you don't get the same quality in taste. I recommend trying something different on the menu from something you'd normally get at another restaurant because it really is a unique experience. This place is great for a date night! I'd definitely come here again and recommend it for people looking for a unique experience or looking for a restaurant with great food.",

An example of this was him explaining how shared dishes work in unnecessarily extensive detail.\n\nWe loved every dish that we ordered. The slaw is a must-have \u2013 the presentation was spot on and it tasted fantastic. The other starters we got included the cheeseburger spring rolls which were a really unique idea and tasted great, however, it was a bit watery. The crispy tofu was perfectly seasoned and combined authentic Asian flavours with other more unique flavours that were well executed.\n\nFor mains, I'd highly recommend the black cod \u2013 the fish was incredibly tender and sweet, pairing well with the sauce and vegetables underneath. We also had the braised beef which was very tender and tasted great with the mushrooms.\n\nIt's also worth to try the desserts. The tong yuen were pretty special in stuffing the Chinese dessert with an unconventional hazelnut chocolate inside.\n\nAside from at the beginning, our waiter was very hospitable and frequently checked up on us. The atmosphere is very lively along with a modern interior that was comfortable to dine in. As a result, is suits a whole variety of different occasions and I'd love to return.",

We got a seasonal alcoholic drink & the Smokey margarita which was both very tasty. We ordered the top chef chicken curry which was the softest chicken we\u2019ve had, the curry was more on the sweet & ginger-y side. We also ordered the fish taco (seasonal), the cheeseburger spring which were both pretty decent compared to the other two dishes we ordered.\n\nOverall, a very good experience! We ended up being really full and maybe would go for 3 dishes next time instead of 4! They even provided a free birthday desert which we really appreciated",

The food was great, the fries were fresh, the burger was good and they had the cooled mugs which some places don't do as much these days.\n\nThe issue is the customers, either students or the people who live or visit the area are extremely sloppy and dirty.\nThey will order a bunch of stuff and literally leave the tables full. It happens at other places on Bloor St West too like Popeye's, Starbucks etc ...\n\nThe staff can't keep up in small location only so many can safely stay behind the counter, if you want these small locations in your area to need to chip in and make sure you clean AFTER YOURSELF. Why were you not taught manners?",

This place is kind of a Toronto staple and I've never been! Was super pleased with my experience will definitely try to return again and enjoy their patio in the warmer months. They have a two level patio!",

This time I ordered the classic breakfast (although it wasn't traditional), and my friend ordered the mushroom omelette.\nMy traditional breakfast consists of three slices of bread, two eggs, a small salad, a very, very tasty hash brown, and optional side dishes (I chose smoked salmon).\nTheir hash browns are shaped like fish cakes, thicker than regular hash browns and round shapes.  It's very crispy outside, and the potato inside is excellent.  I also love their smoked salmon, which is very satisfying.  Their meals are small in size, more like small and delicate meals.  My friend also loves her omelettes.\n\nI like the ambience and setting of the restaurant, and the overall feeling is very comfortable.  It's just that part of the space is very noisy, so it's hard to converse with friends.  The servers are friendly and smiley.  The food is delicious; the portions are small compared to the price, which is not cheap.  However, they have their delicious specialties, so I'll be visiting again.",

We had ordered a chocolate souffle that was unfortunately undercooked but upon our remark, they didn't hesitate to offer us a brand new chocolate souffl\u00e9 and a coffee on them, free of charge due to their kitchen mistake! If you like smaller restaurant with a more low-key comfort vibe this is a good place to try!",

The restaurant feels a little cramped, but that's really looking at the devil in the details. Overall, the food was excellent with a strong balance of flavours. From the house staple Soon Tofu to the Spicy Pork each dish was crafted well and had deep flavour profiles. As a heads up, each main course comes with side dishes (kimchi, bean sprouts, beans). For service, the waitress was extremely welcoming and provided top-level service. However, the guy up front was a little rude, but we looked past that because of the overall service and quality of the food. All in all, a great restaurant that you have to try.",

Their specialty are the tofu soups. They serve it with rice in a stone bowl and some small side dishes. You can crack an egg and add it yourself in your bowl so that it will slowly cook. It was nice and warm. You can chose your level of spicyness. We got the dumpling beef one as well as the vegetable one. They were very good and served hot. The rice was really good. It was a lot of food for me and I could not finish the rice. On weekends and holidays, they don\u2019t split bills so only one person can pay. You can get 10% with takeout only. They have washrooms downstairs. I like that there are hand sanitizers on the tables.",

They have a great selections of chocolate (white, dark, milk, mix, etc.) and you can customize your drinks or order according to your preference. The portion size is pretty generous and it is recommended to order the sharing plate. The chocolate fondue is one of their signature dish that I highly recommend. If it's your first time, I would suggest Cacao 70 Signature Hot Chocolate. It's almost double the price of the regular hot chocolate, but it is served on a cool glassware glazed with chocolate, and you get to mix the drink yourself.\n\nThe service was great even though it was very busy in the evening and there were a long lines. Despite that, the staffs were able to deliver excellent service and get our order quickly. This place is great for all occasion, whether it is a date, hangout with friends, or for family. It is, after all, very cozy and has a good vibes.",

Immediately we were greeted and after a quick scan of the menu we opted for an amazing breakfast sandwich, grilled cheese and hot chocolate and a cacao 70 signature mocha. Everything was great! Service was fast and the area spacious and clean. The signature 70 mocha was delicious!!! Try it! Thank you for a very nice experience!",

Tried the Cacao Blast (milk chocolate), the Cacao 70 Factory Hot Chocolate (dark chocolate) and 2 churro donuts - the coffee and the chocolate peanut butter. The photos probably won't go justice to how good the experience is. For those that love chocolate, this place is an absolute must!",

So RUDY's hamburgers are not just \"a safe bet\" amidst a congregation of poorly designed and love-lacking burgers; you do have to try them out because they're delicious and the best burgers I've had in Toronto. The meat is juicy, the bread is fresh and everything in between is well-balanced.\n\nThe service is decent but the system they have for taking your order and then delivering it (dine-in) seems a bit clunky: the cashier going out to call the names of people that he can't find, bags left on the counter without apparent owner, orders taking too long to be prepared (i had to check with them for mine)... it can improve but i'm mostly calling out the system and not the workers that have to operate around it. Our order took a good while to be ready so there's opportunity here.\n\nThe sheer impressiveness of the burger is enough to make this a 4 stars---but with some caveats on the service. Recommended if you have the chance.",

There's a perfect amount of rudy sauce - enough to add some zing, but not too much that the burger taste is lost.\nThe poutine was surprisingly incredible as well - curds were squeaky and gravy was savoury. Better than some poutine-focused places to be perfectly honest.\nI don't know what else to say, if you like burgers, you can't not come to Rudy at least once.",

The patio is nice, but I personally enjoy sitting inside - it's like being invited over to eat at a family friend's house than being at a restaurant. Service is friendly, personal and absolutely delightful. Food is fairly priced and generously portioned. I recommend the Jamaica and Horchatta drinks for something light and refreshing. There's nothing negative I can say about my experience here!!",

The corn and jalape\u00f1o poppers were really good and we would come back just for those.\nFor mains we got enchiladas and fajitas. They weren\u2019t bad but they weren\u2019t our favourite either. The green sauce with fajitas was very small and everything was a little on the bland side. It didn\u2019t feel worth the price point. The hot sauce helped. Enchiladas were also okay, not bad but not outstanding.\n\nThe one strange thing was that the restaurant had a live band and the band came around while we were eating to tell us they had a surcharge (pay as you wish) but it was weird. I\u2019ve never experienced this at any other restaurant with a live band. I\u2019m also not a huge fan of live music so it was strange to pay for something you don\u2019t particularly enjoy.\nOther than that, I would come back to try other items on the menu and can recommend the corn and jalape\u00f1o poppers, those were really good.",

The only issue was that we had made a reservation, but the restaurant didn\u2019t tell us they were also hosting a big private party that night, and our table was overrun and surrounded by guests from this party. We had to ask them several times to give us some space. We would have appreciated a heads up from restaurant staff that this was going to happen, or to have been seated somewhere else - our table was right in the thick of it. Our server also seemed to forget about us for long periods of time, so we were stuck there for longer than we wanted.\nAll this to say we would overall be happy to go back, but now we know to make sure not to go on a night when they have a big group.",

Note to self: arrive early when there is Saturday night entertainment. The food was excellent and the jalapeno poppers had my nose happily running for the rest of the evening. All dishes we were served or saw were beautifully presented and the young ladies who were handling service were delightful and very hard on the eyes. Hard to stop looking at, that is. Our one concern was that single folks were nursing beers and taking up the space of 4. Some were slumbering fitfully. Eating at the bar sucked with our backs to either our meal or the music. The only other issue I have is that La Rev's web calendar is blank, so we don't know what is happening in future to further entice us to visit again beyond the beautiful ladies, excellent food, entertainment and welcoming atmosphere. BTW, Dom Dunphy has dumped all over a number of businesses in a totally childish and mean-spirited way. When I invited her to dinner at La Rev at my expense so we could see if she might change her mind, she blew her Karen gasket. Pity she acts so hostile, fearful and nasty.",

Staff are eager to make sure everything is exactly how you want it.  The food was good too.  That said, the lamb was requested to be pink/medium but served rare.  It was delicious nonetheless.  The smoked salmon was very fresh.  My guest substituted asparagus for the yam his order would have come with.  It looked wonderful, it cut nicely and the texture was perfect.  My guest was very happy with it until he tasted it.  My guess is the fault was with the asparagus itself because we could find no other fault with it.\nDessert was espresso and a salted chocolate truffle.  A little more salt in the truffle than I like, but still good.  I didn't recognize the region of the coffee used for the espresso, but really liked it too.\nI plan to try what looked like an amazing chicken pot pie on my next visit.",

The prices are incredibly high and the quality and portion size of the food do not meet what you'd expect for the cost.\n\nThe food was not great and we both left hungry because of how little food you get. We ended up needing to go and eat somewhere else directly afterwards despite spending over $50 for 2 meals here. (Also a cup of coffee is $5!!)\n\nVery disappointed in this restaurant. I would not recommend it. Your stomach and wallet will thank you for eating somewhere else.",

I would go for a savory dish with a single pancake on the side next time. I have had similar pancakes at another restaurant with syrup on the side and topped with sour cherries, which I preferred. If you like pancakes and sweet toppings you will like these. The grapefruit spritzer was decent, buy didn't feel worth the price.",

Pancakes are a must-have, but are very sweet so I recommend ordering it as a side (1 pancake vs. 3 as the main).\n\nThey did get my order wrong and gave me home fries instead of a salad, but were quick to rectify! Had a full size complimentary salad.",

Over the weekend, the wait is sometimes over an hour because of the popularity. If you are lucky enough to get in, their pancakes are a must try! It\u2019s so fluffy and full over flavour. I usually share this dish with two other people along with a main dish. Grilled cheese was mediocre but the steak and eggs and the croissant dish was really good.\n\nCall them ahead of time to get an expectation of how busy they are!",

The wait was worth it - we already knew what we wanted when we sat down so it made everything a lot quicker. The service was awesome and because I was celebrating a birthday they even had a little candle and decoration added to the dessert! We'll definitely be returning :)",

I ordered the French toast and oh my god, it was delicious and not pricey. My husband ordered the weekend breakfast and it was very tasty, he fell in love with the sausage and the bacon. He only wishes that the portion of the egg was bigger, it seemed like one egg instead of 2. Also, he asked for scrambled eggs and somehow it was runny. The service was good, and could definitely be better. The coffee was great.\nThe only reason why I am giving 3 stars is because even though our food was amazing we had a hard time enjoying it because of the terrible smoke smell!! What\u2019s up with that?? Are you serious that people are allowed to smoke inside this building?. Can someone explain? I would love to come back with my daughter because she is a fan of French toast, but I am sure she will not tolerate being here for more than 5min. Hopefully they will fix this problem.",

I wanted to love it but the mains took a long time to arrive, and were only warm when we got them. Some of our party members said their food tasted like it was a day old and it was microwaved. I ordered the sweetened iced tea and lemonade, and it tasted like water with mint. The highlights were the appetizers that we got. The calamari breading was crispy and seasoned well. The fries with truffle crema were great. The service was not good though. Our server didn't ask us how we were doing once the entire meal, or ask if we wanted refills. We had to call him over to order dessert because he didn't come back to the table after we asked for the dessert menus. I saw another patron walk up to him to ask him to attend to their table because he was also ignoring them. I wouldn't go back or recommend this location to anyone.",

Miraculously, they were able to seat our large party of 14, out on their patio. Not the most comfortable seating, as we sat on picnic tables. But that was all that was available on a Monday at start of lunch rush. Staff were always courtesy and great under pressure. But do note that it's slow at that time, so plan for enough time, if going during a work day. Individual washrooms are available. Seating is very tight. Not all staff were masked.\n\nFood was good: enjoyed a fresh lemonade and Ricotta Agnolotti.",

It took some time for them to attend to us at the door but understandable since they were quite busy. It definitely helps to reserve a table! I love restaurants with a one page menu.. and even then it was hard to choose with all the good selections. I ordered the arancini for apps which was excellent. I ordered the Potato pizza and I loved it with some chili oil. My friend ordered Linguine ai Frutti di Mare which he really enjoyed. The Lemon Cheesecake was amazing! Not too sweet and I love the passionfruit coulis with it. Honestly I would come back no doubt!",

I always order olives when they\u2019re on a menu- they were particularly yummy! Also ordered the Brussel sprouts, the Ragu, and the pasta special (which was a mushroom pasta). Everything was really good except the service. We didn\u2019t get drinks and our server seemed angry at us for it. They really stopped checking in on our table after clearing our plates- had to go up to the bar to pay our bill. Really enjoyed the food so I will return to try again but didn\u2019t love the service.",

We ordered their eggplant parm which is still one of the best we've had. Crunchy and layered, its a guilty pleasure. A surprise for us was the shaved asparagus pappardelle which had a lighter flavor on a pea puree. Very delicious as well. Not shown are the pizza and the kale salad as both were gobbled up before I considered taking photos of the meal. Our server was fantastic and had great drink recommendations. The atmosphere was warm and cozy for our first return to in restaurant dining since the pandemic started.",

The dining area is very spacious, one can leisurely spend hours there sipping cappuccino and feasting on freshly baked croissants, muffins, danishes, biscottis, and other pastries and tea cakes.\nThe prices are very budget-friendly, with most of the pastries not going over $3 and the most expensive coffee (mocaccino or caff\u00e8 mocha) is priced at $4.75 got a large cup.\nThe free WiFi is offered (the password is abcde12345).\nThe parking lot is adjacent to the cafe, however, due to the commercial nature of the building, to get a parking spot during peak hours could be a challenge.\nDon't try to find any details on the company's website; it is only intended for the espresso and restaurant equipment, the cafe domain is for sale.",

Made things quite efficient.\n\nI ordered the green salad, miso soup, salmon lovers and the cucumber wrapped roll.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have ordered the cucumber rolls (they were delicious but it was too much food for me.)\n\nMy friend had the sushi and rocky mountain rolls - really enjoyed the coconut flakes on the roll, definitely added a different flavour and texture to the rolls.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely return here!",

I did enjoy my chicken and waffles.. we also loved the pancakes and the smoked salmon was nice and fresh from the bennies. The homefries were a tad bit dry and underseasoned. There was a good variety of items on the menu and all decently priced. A nice place to sit after a day of shopping though that's for sure.",

No one was sitting at the bar, only tables.\n\nThe new decor is open and bright with rich touches here and there.\n\nThe food was great. Not a fan of the ricotta (made in house), but the rest of the salad was amazing. Perfect for an afternoon brunch.\n\nHaven\u2019t had a mixed drink I didn\u2019t like here. Their bar staff is always quiet imaginative and forward thinking.",

They had a lovely afternoon tea but unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to experience it this time. We came in excited about the mimosa which was introduced to us at $10 which we thought was amazing! But then the server came back to say they ran out of ingredients and that the only options were cocktails at $18. We weren\u2019t too happy with that. After about 30 mins or so, she finally came back to offer the same price for another cocktail. Changed my mind about the whole experience and so we were very pleased with their ability to offer a solution. We ordered the pancakes which were absolutely devine - fluffy, tasty ricotta cheese with light cream and blueberry sauce. Yummy! Will come back another time.",

The best place to be to feel comfortable and cozy while enjoying great Italian cuisine. On a wonderful note my 6 year old decided to write a not to the chef that everything was so yummy. The server (Roberto) held his hand and took him to the chef. To my surprise the head chef himself came to our table , thanked us for our Son\u2019s gesture and gave us too many desserts to enjoy \ud83d\ude0a we felt so honoured. Thank you team Cibo for your great hospitality. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29",

We chose this for an outing with extended family because of the proximity to where they were staying, but also because the spaciousness of the restaurant would be ideal for having little children in tow. The menu also has decent variety, so there's something for everyone. We ordered salad, pizzas, and pastas, and everything was good. Service was friendly, though there were a few large groups, so perhaps it did get chaotic for our server at times. As a note, larger groups have 18% gratuity automatically added and had to be on one bill (both requirements not unusual for many restaurants), and you need to leave a credit card number for reservations.",

Prices here are very reasonable, especially since it\u2019s downtown Toronto with the ongoing inflation.\n\nI got the small pizza which the chef was generous to make it slightly bigger than the box meant for it. Yes, if you\u2019re looking for \u201cpresentation\u201d, that\u2019s some minus points for the pizza getting slightly folded but for me it\u2019s a bonus as I am here to enjoy the food which I just got rewarded more than what I had paid/expected.\n\nI love the crust of the pizza although the sauce and the overall pizza lacked a bit of flavour or \u2018kick\u2019 as I would put it. My pizza had onions and green peppers as the toppings, both which could\u2019ve been given a bit more generously but for the price and the freshness of the pizza, I can\u2019t really complain.\n\nHowever, I am looking forward to trying their panzerottis which seemed to be very popular with the clientele at this family-run Pizzeria. I will be back for the panzerottis but for the pizza, it won\u2019t be something that I will go out of my way for but it definitely deserves to be on my list of spots for pizzas when I\u2019m on a budget in downtown Toronto.",

We recently had a corporate event here and the staff were so accommodating and wonderful. It was a beautiful day to enjoy drinks on their outdoor patio before we had it inside. We were then given an approximately 90 minute long mixology session which was very interactive in nature and greatly enjoyed by all! They have a number of package options and you would have to contact them directly with your own specific details, but our session had instruction of three different classic and unique cocktails with the opportunity for us to participate hands on. The package s do provide snacks as well which is great as there is a lot of drinking involved! This is a great team building experience and great for private events. Highly highly recommended!",

Luckily I had cousins coming in Toronto and wanted to go to Lee's to celebrate their birthday.\n\nLet me tell you, beginning to end, we were not deceived AT ALL. The quality of service is incredibly amazing, something that I was expecting from this restaurant but they went over my expectations. You don't even notice when their refreshing your plates or refilling your water. We had such an astounding waiter, Conor, he was more than a perfect host. We are glad that we had him serving us. He knew the menu detailed to the bone.\n\nWe were a group of 5 and chose to do the \"Chef's Choice\", I believe that's what its called... We give them a price and they are able to choose your menu. More like a surprise 3 course menu concept. We had so much food that we were all so full at the end that we were scared we wouldn't have any space for dessert. Such a great experience.",

It's best if you share your food here as opposed to individually getting your own meals, as you can try more dishes. I was skeptical about the Singapore style slaw at first as I'm not a fan of regular slaw but it was amazing! It was fresh and full of flavours, 20 ingredients to be exact. The reviews recommended the cheeseburger spring rolls so we got them and they were definitely worth it as well. I recommend getting the goat cheese tart if you're a fan of olives, cheese and philo pastry because it was delicious as well. The Top Chef curry roasted chicken is a must have, each bite had loads of flavour if you ate it with all the sauces and pineapple too. The servers were very knowledgeable about the food and provided great customer service also. We didn't get the signature sangria so I can't speak to that, but the table beside us did and was complimenting it. I was surprised at the quality in the food because for the same price in many upscale restaurants in Toronto you don't get the same quality in taste. I recommend trying something different on the menu from something you'd normally get at another restaurant because it really is a unique experience. This place is great for a date night! I'd definitely come here again and recommend it for people looking for a unique experience or looking for a restaurant with great food.",

An example of this was him explaining how shared dishes work in unnecessarily extensive detail.\n\nWe loved every dish that we ordered. The slaw is a must-have \u2013 the presentation was spot on and it tasted fantastic. The other starters we got included the cheeseburger spring rolls which were a really unique idea and tasted great, however, it was a bit watery. The crispy tofu was perfectly seasoned and combined authentic Asian flavours with other more unique flavours that were well executed.\n\nFor mains, I'd highly recommend the black cod \u2013 the fish was incredibly tender and sweet, pairing well with the sauce and vegetables underneath. We also had the braised beef which was very tender and tasted great with the mushrooms.\n\nIt's also worth to try the desserts. The tong yuen were pretty special in stuffing the Chinese dessert with an unconventional hazelnut chocolate inside.\n\nAside from at the beginning, our waiter was very hospitable and frequently checked up on us. The atmosphere is very lively along with a modern interior that was comfortable to dine in. As a result, is suits a whole variety of different occasions and I'd love to return.",

We got a seasonal alcoholic drink & the Smokey margarita which was both very tasty. We ordered the top chef chicken curry which was the softest chicken we\u2019ve had, the curry was more on the sweet & ginger-y side. We also ordered the fish taco (seasonal), the cheeseburger spring which were both pretty decent compared to the other two dishes we ordered.\n\nOverall, a very good experience! We ended up being really full and maybe would go for 3 dishes next time instead of 4! They even provided a free birthday desert which we really appreciated",

Gave us great recommendations which we throughly enjoyed.\n\nThey do have a break between 4-5 I believe, so get in before or after for food.\n\nJust like Paris, they\u2019ll serve what they have on house so their menu may not always be accurate.\n\nWe ordered the beef tartare, duck confit and steak.\n\nEverything came in at a timely manner - the beef tartare was perfectly seasoned and went well with the spreads on the side. The duck confit really came off the bones and was not dry at all. I ordered it with a salad which was dressed with the perfect amount of crunch and sweetness. The steak was cooked jus the way we wanted and came with its own special sauce.\n\nWill definitely come back to try the oysters and mussels.",

Portions are just right so you can indulge in several options and not feel guilty. Salad was very tasty with the right amount of dressing, mushroom pizza was baked to perfection and pasta was outstanding.\n\nAtmosphere is great and they have an in Store grocery/bakery.\n\nOnly reason I\u2019m not giving 5 Stars is because hostess had some attitude. Additionally we asked for a larger table because we were doing a working lunch and she said no and refused to move us. Despite it never getting full at the restaurant.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend this restaurant for any business  meetings or larger parties for that reason.\n\nI look forward to returning in the future, I recommend this restaurant for groups of 2-4, great setting for a lunch date.",

They have many delicious pastries and good quality bread.\nThey also have a good selection of Italian products.\n\nThe reason I gave 3, is because we went there and bought a couple of pastries and drinks. When we wanted to sit in the dining area, although it was completely empty, they said that we cannot and space is only for dining in. We were not informed about this before ordering so we had to go out in -18 and eat outside .",

The Ravioli with the braised beef...I could have eaten that all night long. Can't wait to go back and try more items off the menu...and we ordered a bunch as it was!",

With drops of lemon,it\u2019s perfect as an appetizer\n\nPizza Regina: the size of the pizza shocked me, presentation was awesome too, with different kinds of cherry tomatoes, prosciutto and cheese, it is the perfect Friday night pizza:)\n\nSeafood pasta: the pasta is harder I would like (it might be the authentic way to do it but I like my pasta soft)",

The calamari fritti had perfect batter that wasn\u2019t greasy. It was light and tasted fresh and the calamari had excellent texture.  The caprese burrata was also very fresh and delicious.  The handmade pasta was soft and lovely. We had the tagliatelle bolognese and the tonnarelli norcina and both were delicious although the tonnarelli was probably the highlight of our meal.  I love the warehouse industrial type of feel to the place too. It\u2019s unique and I\u2019m quite happy this place is in Corktown.  Our server Laura was wonderfully attentive and suggested great wine.  All in all I\u2019d highly recommend this place if you love Italian food !",

I did enjoy my chicken and waffles.. we also loved the pancakes and the smoked salmon was nice and fresh from the bennies. The homefries were a tad bit dry and underseasoned. There was a good variety of items on the menu and all decently priced. A nice place to sit after a day of shopping though that's for sure.",

Not a fan of the ricotta (made in house), but the rest of the salad was amazing. Perfect for an afternoon brunch.\n\nHaven\u2019t had a mixed drink I didn\u2019t like here. Their bar staff is always quiet imaginative and forward thinking.",

They had a lovely afternoon tea but unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to experience it this time. We came in excited about the mimosa which was introduced to us at $10 which we thought was amazing! But then the server came back to say they ran out of ingredients and that the only options were cocktails at $18. We weren\u2019t too happy with that. After about 30 mins or so, she finally came back to offer the same price for another cocktail. Changed my mind about the whole experience and so we were very pleased with their ability to offer a solution. We ordered the pancakes which were absolutely devine - fluffy, tasty ricotta cheese with light cream and blueberry sauce. Yummy! Will come back another time.",

We had no issue except that prepaid breakfast  with the Fuel up for Free offer is disappointing.  How can you mess up breakfast??  1.  Serve crappy coffee (Starbucks is around the corner) 2. Provide poor service.  ie make sure all serving staff disappear at the same time. Repeatedly run out of juice glasses, etc.  Food was consistently mediocre.  We stayed 4 nights, 1st breakfast was Ok , 2nd became a little painful, 3rd was  the breaking point. 4th was enjoyed elsewhere.Would stay again but no more breakfast.",
